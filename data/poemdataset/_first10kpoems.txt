2 ABC of H.k. and China revised vision.
Barrels tears are wines and salts.
With a whisk on goody tails!
Wiggle maces to fix the heads.
Heads in jack on boxes are ceased.
Cry to paranoid truly bosses.
Bosses are jokers take your boys.
Studs are bogs with fire apples.
True predicates worth cases.’
Descents wash in badly bands.
Wholly sales are smart with cats.
Who got tenth honors in China?
Homage grand to play and plays!
Trim the times of hearts then cry.
Tanks in steels but voice wail.
Bossy dragged by tails that whisked.
Go very timid and love the wise.
Hands are lent but laws are ends.
Cases on courts are borrowed lands.
Length long with treads to retch!
Straps on times and watch here.
Arrays tanks but all are men.
Cross all suctions steal the ends.
Cave on minds are cages on objects.
Rouser rockets powers holes.
Confine curses to stop our wounds.
Whirl your bodies and jump on grounds.
Crouch of soldiers after kicks with flings.
Block one leg and hit the middle.
Cauchy3 know the tricks to kill.
Threaten weak oppressed ill.
Surpass scores are bad in honors.
Wash to think that build the homes.
Angel sins but cauchy3 has funs.
Make ones tools when hats are found.
Worlds are drawers on bottom noses.
Singular ugly piece is rose.
Wily mores are teeth of sharks.
Saw with tooth is laws in arts.
Artful men power with grids.
Bodies stamped and wills are ridden.
Sign in forth with battles conquered.
Triumphs on candles whip the stands.
Soups are soaps and faiths not come.
We are meats in balls and rice to constants.
---Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3---Apparently life without love, is no life at all.
Become an advocate of true love.
Control your innermost emotions.
Decide your worth, fulfill your desires.
Written:  Oct.16/06A abc angles on angels flaws (poem)
Mix with means and assets
Passive and active to abase the men
Heels and knees rent for renown
Breeds the breads to be demanded
Assert to assist by blocks of boards
Necks and necks to bad affairs
Moneys pay for debts in doubles
Laws are raw to protect with doubts
Shams are shames to have costs
Shams on sheets incubated courses
Lack of actions to freedoms and justices
Nouns are in ounces and loves are in pounds
Control the concepts of wielding guns
Control the concepts of smith for guns
Put the concepts of tyrants on hell
To hell real tyrants have helps
Hounds and eagles should focus on hunting
Expect the evils to be saints on junctions
Axes and awls are lying below
Awnings are answers with piss and pee
Peek on peaks of powers to be laws
Whales on whips are wheat to sharks
Weeps when sweep in clocks of Gods
Corrections of cotillions like hoofs
Zeroes in zeal for facts and morals
Morales are guns that march and move
Laws are lost and twist a lot
Terms in targets have not effects in long
Stay in dark or run from dart.
Stray to cycles of cruel ranges
Laws as can be rights are none
Table lands are tables with spoons
Monks have manners to list on tables
Jack apples are appetites on tabs
Whales on whips are wheat to sharks
Baby fishes are preys in bays
To be back in the passes to wash by bloods
In themes of theory our rights are loud
Next days are dated with truths or false
Flaws in angles of angels are small
Wings when wink to rains give no shelters
Bloods are buses to carry to hell
Wash their shames but leave our rights
A network of flatterers is in wires
--Political poem by Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3--A abc Brazil dance (poem)
Jack of crack in pots of crack
Sambas have bugs on figs that take
My heart has unseen bugs in acting
Ghosts haunt in cavern with heal
Empty stream in holes to steal
Barrow has one wheel for near
Wheel and deal are those on top
Tares are on suits but meadows are women
Dilate the prizes of prides on top
We are all cogs to tone
Harps be fine and fingers be good
Jacks play with their fingers on goods
The sun on Asia sky may be red
Give the logistics are logics to pets
Patterns of Gods are king s bodies.
Launch the papers on lunches to bowls
That faces of poets help to smiles
Admire the distances from hade to a mile
Pleasures of leaders are earned by rows
Would there be sweats on brows when bow
Pietisms on parts are wholesome in vices.
Wise in acre but bully to eyes
Rusts are here yellows are pearls
Dittos on powers but flaw to react
Crooks roll your minds with hopes
Cogs in times lead us homes
Straps on times watch ones feet
Even are evil while equal are eerie
Only our planet with one sun
Falcons are slow down on bushes
Salty weathers salute to soldiers
Sambas of fortunes have just to sold
Passes on stages are passages to fires
Books on accounts are moneys to fine
Sambas of fortunes have just to sold
Sambas of fortunes have just to sold
Vectors pf suns are heats and flames
Bind to lines on sky when claimed
Plash and slash on lakes when free.
Brazil should breach on tank s wheels
Stand off and away from tanks
Red suns have white heats
Friends for wines and for wench
Stand away from tanks ends
--Political poem by Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3--The ABC was our song, we'd hummed it together
the night we'd met. We couldn't believe we knew it too.
Then the plastic snail came along with its Hawking recording -
we rolled him to the cat tray on his yellow wheels.
Together we sang the melodic sequins of it opening
the ups & downs of each cadence Aaa Bee Cee Dee Eee Fff Ggg
and stuck with it through the military rattle of l,m,n,o,p,
to where it begins to fall apart in Tourette's phonetics
and never recovers. The ‘and' between ‘Y and Z'
is an affront to the tonally deaf. It becomes like jazz
- in its aleatory nonsense - and we fuckin hated jazz.
But I loved that song, I thought it was ours.A poem is not more absurd
Because its title is no word:
And yet that title, although small,
Is the great fountain whence spring all.
From this most copious source we'll draw
Youth, beauty, wedlock, love, and law.
The two extremes we'll surely find.
Which please and which torment the mind
For if we love and law can trace
'Twill be sufficient for our case.
A parson's work it nicely fits,
Who often join two opposites.
Nothing on earth the heart can move
To pleasure, like that passion love.
It reigns triumphant in the breast;
Supports and governs all the rest.
But Law's a monster that devours
The choicest comfort of your hours.
All other mischiefs may keep off;
Involv'd in law, you've plague enough,
This maxim then admits no doubt,
He who is in would fain be out.
Long dissertations are absurd--
We'll close without another word.
THE SECOND PART
As much of love shall now be told
As ever A. B. C. can hold.
That urchin Cupid knows his duty;
He'll always shoot a heart for beauty;
This he more eagerly will deign,
Because he seldom shoots in vain.
If Plutus too should give a nod,
He's willing to obey the god;
For wealth and charms in any state
Most certainly will captivate.
But if Miss Prudence claims his care,
'He seldom has a dart to spare.'
Thus what should merit most respect
Is apt to meet with most neglect.
Of all the pictures earth can boast,
A handsome woman pleases most;
And the most powerful she appears
Over fourteen or fourscore years.
The moment you a sight can have,
That moment you become her slave.
The looker-on is all on fire
Either with wonder or desire;
Supremely then is beauty bless'd;
No creature is like her caress'd.
But view the fair in her last stage,
Struggling with long decays of age,
When kind assistance is most needed,
There's not a soul so little heeded.
The picture's dash'd, no pity's nigh,
The looker-on turns off his eye:
In solitude she may abide;
Her sov'reign powers are laid aside.
That which was most of all high-priz'd.
Is now the most of all dispis'd.
Only three persons we'll engage,
By summons to adorn our page;
And all their names must secret be
Close shelter'd under A. B. C.
Miss A. was tall, and mov'd with grace;
Strait, and most beautiful of face;
To much good-nature was inclin'd;
It play'd both in her face and mind:
No wonder then, in deep surprize,
B fell a victim to her eyes;
For when those eyes but gave a glance,
A lover fell-you'd think, by chance.
But, should you doubt, then take a view,
You'd see her powers--and feel them too:
For, like a power that's magical,
Spite of yourself you're sure to fall.
In lover's eyes are plainly seen
The language that is held within.
With bowing, smiling, on his part,
He found the road that reach'd her heart;
While she, a stranger to disdain,
Would never let him sue in vain;
But, form'd for love, she, without guile,
Sweetly return'd him smile for smile.
Should, by her eyes, a lover drop,
She well knew how to raise him up.
Or, if he should a wound endure,
She'd perfectly perform a cure.
That state of bliss is half divine
When two bright flames in one shall join.
Can greater happiness remain
Than love, and be belov'd again?
When two folks are to union prone,
Then Hymen's cause moves gently on.
To grasp his torch he will not faulter,
That he may light them to the altar.
Examine whether 'tis in case right,
Give it a rap to make it blaze bright.
The banns put up, the ring was there,
The bride in satin would appear.
Now all the joyous blessings flow,
Except that time mov'd rather slow.
When most delicious fruit is nigh
It strongly tempts the stander-by;
And if no obstacle is near,
It is not easy to forbear.
What motive was there to have staid
Until the parson grace had said:
Our happy B those joys possess'd
Design'd to make a husband bless'd.
When a stale lover nothing wants,
Because he's all the sex e'er grants,
Would he call his a happier lot
After the priest had tied the knot?
For all that ever law has made
Only a licence is to trade.
No further pleasure B could know;
She no more pleasure could bestow:
A secret coldness was th' effect,
Succeeded by a small neglect.
His eyes, which met her eyes with glee,
Now rang'd a foot below her knee.
A conduct slighting he shew'd to her
More like a husband than a wooer.
The day pass'd by, indiff'rence planted,
Ring, gown, and parson, were not wanted.
'And, as the bell for supper rings,
I'll stop to say no more fine things.'
THE THIRD PART
Both law and love compose the past;
Poetic justice comes at last.
Love, like a blooming rose, is press'd
Within the precincts of the breast.
The owner often casts an eye,
Delighted with the pleasing toy.
Perhaps an hour it may not rest
Till planted in a second breast.
So on, from breast to breast it flies;
Wanting a prudent root it dies.
A young and handsome man was C;
The friend and intimate of B:
They oft converse, and notes compare,
Of laurels gather'd from the fair.
Between these two it was agreed
'That B should be compleatly freed
Of beauteous A; and C should take her
While B for ever should forsake her.
That as the banns 'twixt A and B
Stood in the church, they'd serve for C;
By which they'd save expence and time,'
And I procure a word to rhime.
Whether Miss A ponder'd a while on't
We cannot say; history is silent:
Yet no more grief appear'd to view
Than changing an old gown for new.
But now to church went A and C,
And married in the name of B.
The joyous day gave great delight;
Perhaps more joyous was the night;
But, like his predecessor, he
Cropp'd the ripe fruit, and left the tree:
For soon with matrimony cloy'd
He turn'd his tail upon the bride.
What though his conduct was absurd,
It left her ready for a third.
Nor can we think much hard her case
Who still commanded half the race.
Her beauty'd such a powerful sway
'Twould pick a man up ev'ry day.
Now while Miss A'd no husband near
She liv'd a life of 'as it were.'
Her person to support in state
Was much inclin'd to run in debt;
And when we debts contract, they say,
The time will come when we should pay.
But if neglect be on our side
Compulsive methods must be tried.
For common justice holds this tone,
'That ev'ry man should have his own.'
In vain for cash Miss A being sought
Was to the Court of Conscience brought.
The plaintiff thus the fair pursued,
In C's surname Miss A was sued.
The crowd, surpriz'd, began to stare
That so much beauty enter'd there.
Nay, cold Commissioners, 'tis true,
Would lick their lips and steal a view.
Thaw'd from the ice by warm desire,
A frozen stick will catch the fire;
Disguise the passion how you will,
'Tis nature, and 'tis nature still.
But seniors are not apt to fall;
To look and lick their lips is all.
A lawyer made appearance there,
And loudly pleaded for the fair;
Arrang'd his tropes, his figures dress'd,
In lofty stile himself express'd:
And pray what lawyer would dispute
To plead his best in beauty's suit?
But what was his retaining fee
Is no concern to you or me.
He pleaded with decisive air;
Resolv'd to win the cause--and fair:
'That none an action can support
Against a wife in any court.
That though her marriage had a flaw
It perfectly was good in law;
For as the ritual she'd gone through,
A wife must be to one of two;
And that's her real husband still
With whom she said at church I will.
Then if the plaintiff will pursue,
The husband is the mark in view.'
The bench was then my sole delight;
My care was parting wrong from right.
As I sat president of three,
Decision was referr'd to me.
'Was perfect beauty ever made
To hawk its charms for want of trade?
We hope no great defect comes forth
To quash the sale of so much worth.
That she ne'er chang'd a marriage vow
With the first man, we all allow;
So far from marrying the dame,
He never to the altar came;
Nor once commission'd any one
By proxy, to make her his own.
Nor could she be by right fix'd there,
No, not if Madan held the chair;
For he'd suppose, without reflection,
This might not be her first connexion.
Survey the second husband's claim;
His title will be found the same:
He left both parties in the lurch,
And put a trick upon the church.
A name that's stolen appears to view;
Also a borrow'd person too.
No banns put up 'twixt C and A,
Which must to wedlock lead the way;
For this is what the law demands;
On this a union falls or stands;
Therefore, if marriage has a flaw,
It can't be ratified by law.
Then this assertion springs from all;
No man can this a wedding call:
Or, if it should that phrase invite,
'Tis but the wedding of a night;
Or like one that is hatch'd up quick
By dancing round a candlestick;
Or one of military stamp,
That's solemniz'd within a camp:
The loving couple's plighted word
Is only jumping o'er a sword;
That sword, intended to divide,
Will there unite, and make a bride.
Besides, when there appears demur,
We must consult the register;
And though there should B's name appear,
Yet B himself was never there;
and if for C you chuse to look,
His name was never in the book.
This wedding's founded on no laws;
We must, of course, dismiss the cause;
For as a husband A ne'er knew,
No husband can the plaintiff sue;
But if he will pursue his claim,
May still sue A in her own name.
There's one delightful word we see
Compos'd of our A B and C.
To girls, whose flimzy virtue lies
Quite dormant, and whose passions rise,
That dear word husband stands the first
Of all the alphabet can boast:
In that cornpriz'd is every thing
That either Heaven or Earth can bring;
But, when that blessing husband's granted,
Then ev'ry other blessing's wanted.'
A, rather out of credit grown,
Display'd her charms upon the town.
'But why in Birmingham appear
Among the dirty bunters there?
Whose manners are a foul disgrace;
A satire on the female race.
She might a constellation rise,
And figure in the London skies;
Could charms display as bright as any,
In evenings when it was not rainy.'
'Tis done--and she acquir'd renown,
As the first beauty on the town.
Dress'd in the pink, she took her stand
Among the ladies of the Strand.
Thus beauty, by imprudent steps,
To sure destruction slowly creeps.
For she, when to that bevy's got in,
Takes much about three years to rot in.
The silent priest
We'll tell simple truth, and our story comes pat,
No matter if acted in this age or that.
Dear Friend, let us saunter to Baxterly church,
Where good Mr. D--left himself in the lurch;
For there the gay hearer will, sure as a gun,
Meet with a sweet morsal of high-season'd fun.
The pray'rs being ended, and no blunder made,
The Clerk his desk mounted--he well knew his trade;
Two staves out of Sternhold he struck up compleat,
While climbing the pulpit the Priest took his seat.
Now heav'nly music, a Clerk's highest boast,
Calm'd every breast, but the Vicar's the most.
The psalm being over, deep silence came next;
Not a single breath sounded, expecting the text;
But, to the surprize of the serious and gay,
The Vicar himself was as silent as they;
For he'd dropt to sleep, being drench'd with mild ale,
And dream'd of full bumpers, the last night's regale;
Or, rather, till five in the morning had hanker'd,
Before he could find the last drop in the tankard.
Now the congregation became rather wild,
They look'd at the Priest, at each other, and smil'd.
If a shepherd should fall fast asleep in the day,
No wonder his flock goes a little astray.
Then Moses look'd up--'Sir, we've done,' cried Amen;
The Priest, half awake, replied, 'Fill it agen.'A nother poem—A different A isle

W spells the most important ‘We’,
And XYZ spell everything special,
that cannot be put into words,
that make my childhood,
the most beautiful memory!All issues are politicized and political game is played
Before any solution is found for anything by politicians;
Careful manipulation with words they pull on the days in
Dragging all matters that can be solved till poll comes!
Every matter is kept in the back burner unless it's profitable
Fully satisfying their political mileage in the election;
Good or bad, they don't care except their victory is confirmed
However easy or difficult the coming elections are concerned!
Icon of the political arena takes the lion's share in the spoil;
Joint ventures too, they prefer, if the passage is easy to go through
Keeping in view a massive victory for the next term in power;
Likewise, the plan and move the coins to win in the political game!
Matters of vital importance they take up in hand to convince all;
No matter however tedious or trivial once they become popular sure;
Opposition parties, if they are strong, grease their palms to win;
People are hoodwinked as all things take place behind the curtain!
Questions of burning problems are prolonged till people forget them;
Respecting the sentiments of the people, they play the game long
Surviving, sustaining and succeeding in every move of their game;
The final stage is placed in great suspense to take advantage of weakness!
Ultimately the good hearted and innocent people are the victims;
Varieties of cosmetic lures they make like expert advertisements to
Win in the polls to power only to play the card of sentiments ever!
X men like display of their influence they show to cajole new ones;
Years of such techniques make them experts in winning the game sure;
Zero is the benefit and solution to problems people get forever...!There are three ways to prevent HIV/AIDS
Rather be sorry afterwards, follow the ABC
of safer sex!
ABSTINENCE
This means not having sex, not having sex at
all can be very difficult for many people.
You could choose a different kind of sexual
expression such as masturbation either on
your own or with your partner.
BE FAITHFUL
Only have sex with your own partner.
If you break-up or find a new partner,
you need to know that that person does
not have an STI or HIV then you needs
to trust each other for life.
Be honest and tell your partner if you
are unfaithful so that your partner can
be protected by using a condom.
CONDOMS
Use condoms,
If you can not manage without having sex
If you have more than one partner
If you don’t know whether your partner is faithful to you
If you think your partner might have STIs or HIVArmed with aptitude, ambition, ability;
being yourself all the time;
carrying calmness of mind and clarity of thought;
dressed in desire, determination, discipline and dedication;
enveloped in effulgence, empathy and enthusiasm;
fired by faith and fervor and
graced by gratitude and good health.
Hard work, honesty and humility,
intellect, intuition,  indefatigable passion and
joie de vivre – all these being your friends always.
Kindness in thought, word and deed and
laziness always kept at bay.
Making the most of your time,
never thinking of ever giving up
or being afraid of taking a risk,
putting your heart, mind and soul into everything,
questioning yourself all the time and
rectifying mistakes made along the way.
Self-confidence and a strong desire
to make it to the finish line…
using whatever resources available and
vocalizing only positive thoughts.
When things don’t seem to go your way,
(e) xtraordinary patience and perseverance will pay.
You will see in the end that
zenith is not too far away.

5 pmDid the CIA tell the FBI that it knows the work of the IRA?
Just as the RCMP confused the PLO with Al-Quaieda?
The biggest weapon of terror is alphabetic confusion,
It blends together ignorance, fanaticism with dogmatic infusion.
For the homeless, poor and hungry, there is basic need,
To the yammering of the privileged and rich they do not heed.
Food and medicine for all is delayed by poor distribution,
It’s waylaid by the mighty against retribution.
It’s hardly a wonder the world’s a more dangerous place,
That the rich and famous try to escape into space.
But the Almighty knows who deserves to be here,
And it’s not the humble and poor, who have something to fear.A-biding in
B-ringing terror by
C-reating absolute
D-evastation to countryDark clouds gathered overhead,
Expelling bullets of rain;
Filling up the valley floor—
Guzzling poisonous shrubs
Just wait there soaking up life.A vigilante lacking of heroic qualities that
Brings death to every damn
Criminals he mercilessly preyedA   gain with the pain,
B   eing left alone.
C   rying in the rain,
D   escending like stone.
E   very one laughs and points,
F   elt paralyzed through my spine.
G   etting looser at the joints,
H   earing about you, who used to be mine.
I   ncomplete is how I am feeling,
J   ust going through this day by day.
K   ill the pain I am concealing,
L   ove never again this way!
M   ental note to keep in mind,
N   ear to the end of my road.
O   bviously I was a little blind,
P   hrasing your words in code.
Q   uiet down and leave me be,
R   ush yourself to a far off place.
S   ee how bad you've hurt me,
T   rying to forget your face.
U   nited we once were,
V   eered off to one side.
W   elcomed you...  Immature,
X - perienced... My love had to subside.
Y   ou aren't here, but you are there,
Z   ipping up these emotions, because now I don't care!(A Diamante Poem)
Brain
Heavenly, hellish
Floating, raising, falling
Beyond the truth, behind the truth
Leading, relishing, suffering
Sybaritic, pathetic
HumanA total lack of trust
Because of past hurts
Cut me down so low,
Drowning in my lonliness
Enveloped by the pain
From one thing or another
Give it another shot
Hard as it may be
I can not and do not want to lose hope
Just because some people are jerks
Keep your chin up
Look beyond the pain and hurt
Make the best of your situation
Never expect anything from anyone, for
One other than yourself may
Prey upon your weaknesses
Quit allowing anybody in.
Remember, no one will meet all expectations
Stick to your guns
Treat everyone the same
Ugly as so many may be
Vivid projection of their grotesque demeanor
Worldly people,  full of hate
X-ray their hearts to the best of your abilities
You and only you can control your happiness, be
Zealous in all things happyAgain the rain is back after a year or so,
Buzzing of the clouds jolts one and all.
Clouds are having no mercy.
Drops of water are dazzling on the leaves.
Everyone is enjoying a cup of hot coffee or tea.
Fingers are trying to catch those tiny drops.
Ground is flooded with flowing water.
Hairs are unable to hold the water.
In every way I wish to dance, but I couldn't do so.
Juxtapose the mountains and hill it gushes,
Kazoo of paper boat makes music to the ears.
Love the fall and on the tin roof.
My life rejuvenates after seeing this beauty again.
No other occasion makes me feel esthetic.
Over and above the sky gets cleared.
Pulling up our umbrellas I enjoy a walk.
Quite interesting it is to take a ride on a bike.
Rinsing the dirt settled on the building and the floors.
Surprised I am, by the package of a lightning in between.
Tonight reflection of the moonbeams will enthrall.
Unique nature will pay a tribute to the clouds.
Very happy I am, flying without wings.
What a joy to all the living creatures.
Xylem of energy will flow everywhere.
Yes, my heart, my body and my soul all wet tonight.
Zillion drops scattered all over the earth again.Any Body Can Do Everything.
From Greatness, Hope, Invincibility.
Just Kill Lame Melancholy Nothings Other People Quote.
Realize Self.
Totally Undeniably Value Whatever Xplains You, Zealously.Another thought comes to mind,
Before it can be stopped,
Carefully i tread,
Down the path,
Every step a new mistake,
Free from thoughts,
Going no where,
Hating the way thing are,
Itching for a change,
Just a small change,
Knowing it never will,
Loving him still,
Making it worse,
Never an escape,
Once it's begun,
Pleading for it to end,
Quiet now,
Resting from the sleepless night,
Sincerely wishing for peace,
Taking everything,
Under the shelter,
Vex me no more,
Waiting for it,
X-rays of my heart,
Yearning for cover,
Zero strength lefta walk to have
be the one
come with the truth
dream the best not the worst
even if the worst is true
forget about it
give in? not a chance
have to walk back
i know you dont want to
just do it anyways
know the truth

xylophone plays in the background

zero mistakes you made in this walkIf life was as simple
As ABC
I would climb on
My bicycle,
Ride to the sea
I would rip off
My clothes,
Unbuckle my boots,
Run naked over
Lapping waves,
Ignore all the looks
I would swim out
On the ocean,
Swim back twice as fast,
Tie a scarf around
My waist,
Forget the troubled past
I’d cycle back
To Belfast, walk
Naked through the town,
Convince the people
I’m the one,
A Prophet of renown
I’d be like John
The Baptist,
My scarf around
My loins,
I’d shout my
Head off
Through the streets
And dodge
The flying coins
I know they’d think
I’m crazy,
I know they’d
Want me dead,
Because I know
They don’t like change,
I know I’d lose, my headCan I break tradition?
Will it be okay?
I'll ruin your mission,
'Cause I want a say
In this life of mine
I have no control
The voice of the divine
Speaks to my soul
Trapped in a position
To act against my will
This is the worst condition
That makes you want to kill
I don't want to be youABC
Alphabet spaghetti for tea,
Books to read tonight,
Coursework to do oh dear.
By Christopher TyeABC… sing to D
And jump over E

Ask P to come in Q

S will sing a beautiful song and
T will dance with U
V’s voice will not disturb WXYZ.I got to ‘A’ and was assaulted and abused
And attacked and ambushed and anger was used
And acute agony left me anxious and bemused
Then went to ‘B’ and got bloodied and battered
And burnt and bashed and bruises were scattered
And beaten and bones were broken and shattered
I then gave up when a friend told me
Worse things happen at ‘C’Animals are my friends
Baby animals I like best
Cats live in my house
Dude is one of the five cats
Everyday I have to feed them
Feeding time is funny to watch
Growling and hissing starts
Hitting and scratching are next
If you put their food dishes close
Justin’s cat is called Jack-Jack
Kittens are cute but they grow up
Litter box litter box, you smell bad
Mom’s cat is called Whoa – Dxx-xx
None of the other cats like Phantom
Only my brother Andrew helps him
Phantom is a black and white cat
Queen of house we have none, only male cats
Rabbits are my next pets, I have two
Snakes, we had three, now only one
Turtles we had before, but they got away
Ugly or cute, I love all my pets
Very few animals I do not like
Wales are too big to be pets
X, I don’t have, but could try an Ox
Yak is another animal I don’t have
Zebra, it is like a striped horse, I love them tooYou sit left to me,
You don't wanna see,
What's really inside me.
Do you want to hurt me?
You could tell it everyone!
Would it make you feel better?
You don't know anything about me.
My new name for you is 'ABC'
I don't need lipstick for attention,
I also never owned extentions.
The only problem I ever had was you
and what you used to do.
And the last thing I tell you about me,
is why you're so much weaker than me:
You only blance on a tightrope that's lying on the floor,
I'm doing the same but over a huge gorge.
©Again wit the pain
Blinded by lovee
Cant c pass the lies
Dumb for believeing that u loved me
Enough is enough
Feeling alone like always
Guilt, like its my fault
Hoe is wat u left me for
Is love for me?
Just handling this day by day
Kiss my ass nd say goodbye
Lies were all u told me
My love for u was a joke
Never trust again
Obviously i ment nothing
Pain is all i feel
Questioning me on wat love is
Regert meeting u
See how bad yyu hurt me?

Inner peace is effortless, as it’s always there within.
One just has to see it.
And once one truly sees this inner peace – not with words or just
intellectually, but actually see this inner peace within – it is one’s, always;
no one takes away that…
Nothing and no evil and no violent force or even the most difficult
of circumstances in  one’s life can remove that inner peace that one
sees within; but let one see this not as a word, or as a phrase
but as an actuality.
Feel that peace, see that inner peace and let it radiate always – for it is
the harmony within each and it is always one’s own.
A
Let amity be your constant companion….Be at peace with all beings, equally at peace with those near and those far, and thus walk hand in hand with amity as in a bounteous garden…
B
Be mindful of your blessings always…To be alive, to breathe in fresh air;
and to be with  the family and the companionship of good fellow-human
beings; and the kindness of strangers; and the creatures of this world
and the flowers that bloom, and to have a place in this marvelous planet
of ours….all these too are blessings….
There is a life of the body in the domain of the physical, and
the legitimate needs of the body are just as important as
one’s inner needs…
C
Think critically….even while we love and are at peace with the world,
do not forget to think critically for oneself so that one is  not the fool
of the cunning…and thus thinking for oneself carefully and critically
one keeps one’s time and energy and one’s own mind….
Do your own thinking; allowing others to do your thinking for you
is to systematically lose one's will to live life to its fullest...
Freshness comes when one discards clichés in word, thought and
deed – and with freshness comes vigor, steadiness and wisdom….
Though one may mature and grow in intellect, let the child be in
you always. For each moment in which one ceases to be a child,
one is but walking dead.
D
Death is only part of a process in our lives….it is but another phase
as is one’s birth….
Witness the wonder of this process and constant change, and
marvel at it as one marvels at sunset and sunrise – and thus is there
no agony or ecstasy but quiet and cool contemplation of birth, our day to day
living and death….the whole of which is life...
Die to each moment; die to each memory and die to each event
and each day - and thus is there constant renewal and the ever new,
and so one sees for oneself there is truly no fear in death.
E
…equanimity is priceless...there is no need for wildness in joy or agony;
as the tides come and go so do our mental states, and all that we consider
bad or good….like the rise of the moon, or the coming of the stars
and the going of the stars are our emotions and our lives and our happiness
and sorrows….see them for what they are and equanimity dwells shining
within one always….
F
The free mind is the greatest blessing….Be free of conditioning and
be free of propaganda; be free of identity and of the group, and one is truly
free; be free of the past in all its forms as it arises in the mind as
remembrance of hurts and wrongs, and be free of the future as it arises
as constant planning and anticipation and unnecessary tension….
But what is the free mind? One is not free who allows it be defined
for one.
Be free of anyone who will teach you: there is no relative
freedom – only complete freedom…
During one’s meeting or interaction with another being – any being,
human or creature - be mindful of the question: Am I fair to this being?
And after one’s meeting or interaction with another being – any being,
human or creature - be mindful of the question: Have I been  fair to this being?
G
There is  grace in your heart, in your mind and in your very being…delve deep within and see it - let it glow, and that grace will show in the smoothness of your very movement and speech; and that grace will flow in your manner, and that grace will fill your life and each moment with peace, charm and joy….
God? I have no use for God as I have no use for clichés.
H
Neglect no aspect of your being – for each aspect of your being is necessary and good.
Find for yourself all dimensions of your being…see what happens and what you need in each dimension…be moderate and sufficient in each dimension, and there will be no tension there in any of your dimensions of your being, and thus harmony is yours….
I
Insight is when you can see beyond words and the intellect…as when one feels the presence of love and wisdom...let your insight and your intuition live and flourish – for to suppress it is to deny yourself wisdom and inner light…
Words are useless and mislead in the inner life and therefore it is in the light of insight and intuition that one has direct seeing of what actually is….
J
Rejoice in the joys of others...rejoice in the happiness of others…rejoice in
your own joy…find the joy within yourself and the joy in the world…
Be fair and just – not so that one may be loved by others or so one may escape punishment or so one may enter heaven, but be just for its own intrinsic beauty.
K
There is a kingdom within that is not by any other but oneself….there is chaos there if one rules unwisely, and there is joy and harmony if one enters
in wisdom….peace and harmony radiate there in that kingdom of your
own wisdom, and not by the power or grace or authority or wisdom of
others…No being, however mighty and however supernatural, can effect
order in there…The kingdom is only of oneself and yet in oneness…
Enter therefore your own kingdom wisely, enter in your own wisdom…
L
All that there is in the world is love….All the many and countless words
and revelations and traditions and systems are all but love….
All the world’s Holy Books and Revelations and Sermons are useless – there is only love…
The love in which there is conflict or tension, the love in which one
seeks to own or possess or to carve out a territory or group or personal
identity or salvation or gain or protection – that is not love…
The love that includes all and that excludes none, the love that knows
no hate or violence or tension or expectation or punishment
or reward – that is love….
We have allowed the idea and myth of God to replace the  reality
of Love: forget about God for the only reality is Love…
We are liars…we are drugged by lies and
addicted to lies…but while it is easy to see the lies told to one or the
lies one tells others, it is more difficult to see the lies one tells oneself…
M
Be mindful of the moment….be mindful of one’s breath – of the breath as one exhales, as one inhales…be mindful of the emotion or thought that arises, that lives and that subsides…
....with no censure, no judgment, no labels, no memory-making and cherishing of experiences…be mindful too of walking or of sitting; be mindful of each act and thought…
And so does one live the moment and so thought and time - the past and future - lose their tyrannical hold on the mind…
N
Be mindful too of the nuances of the words we utter and use; be mindful of the nuances of one’s speech and actions and one’s silence and one’s inaction…
O
Observe with no imprint…observe with no judgment or residue…observe what actually is…
observing a tree
You see the tree….see what is; see it as it is, not with all of one's conditioning…you look…one does not form a judgment and an attachment and a craving for a repetition of this event - but just observe with no labels…no naming…one sees what is there before one without a name, for the name is the past…just observe what is…
observing the mind
One observes what is – one observes one’s mind, oneself - not as what authority says one is, but as one actually sees oneself; direct and straight seeing oneself…
One sees oneself without the conditioning and with no prejudice; one sees what actually is…
One observes the activities of the mind…one sees the emotion or thought that arises, as it lives and as it subsides…one does not name the emotion or thought, for to do so is to bring in conditioning which is the tyranny of thought; one does not label it and one does not feel guilt or like or dislike…one merely observes what actually is…
One who observes one’s mind knows oneself – not oneself as some abstract and superhuman eternal entity, but as one is….Not second-hand - but directly, for oneself...
Not as what tradition or scriptures or science or reports tell us what we are – but as one actually observes and as one sees what is…
How can one know anything without knowing oneself? Of what use is your knowing of all that you know without self-knowledge as you actually are, and not according to some theory or report or ideology?
P
There are things and events you have control of – and how you pace these that are within your  control determines how much peace and quiet there is in your heart…
Know then the rhythm at which your mind moves and pace the events you
have control of at this rhythm…
For things one has no control of, one’s wisdom will bring a harmony between one and what faces one…
..inner peace is never lost; it’s always there just below the apparent surface of discord. One simply dives deep enough to see this peace that pervades and that never leaves one, though one may be distracted by insistent diversions…
Q
It may seem one’s life is a quest and one searches and searches - and yet in that moment of awareness, of full attention, one sees there is no search, there is no arriving – for it is always there, it is always here and now…
There is no such thing as a quest; there is no such thing as a search…
R
Rest well….one forgets in one’s hurry that simple rest can revitalize and bring freshness…
S
Speak gently, speak quietly; speak words that soothe and heal, and with no intent to hurt. Speak words that bring amity, calm and peace and not words that promote division, anarchy and discord.
T
Thought may be the remembrance of cultures and technology that move societies forward, but thought can be mostly of the past that is a burden…
Be free of the past then and make no memory of it; for the past restricts and narrows and confines, and not making a memory of it is freedom….
U
The world’s systems and hierarchy and Revelations aspire to drag everyone into uniformity and mediocrity…
To lead or to follow is to be mediocre – and the mediocre cannot allow independence…
This world of set formulas and systems despises free inquiry and wants to see each one of us the same in mind and habit and thought: it demands we crawl into its traditions and prescribed or revealed creed, and to fit into what it teaches is the way to be…
The world says this is the way things are and expects one to conform or to break…
Know what you are, know yourself - or the world subtly but swiftly transforms you into itself…
See what actually is rather than going the set ways of what one likes it to be or what should or ought to be or what is described to be …Discard all authority and see for yourself what actually is…
V
Let there be vigor in all things one does; let there be vigor in thought, in
one’s inquiry, in one’s speech and in one’s works and deeds.
The most inspired moment in one’s life is when vision unfolds
naturally within; dullness comes of conditioning and beliefs that are
the companions of complacent inquiry.
W
There is no treasure like the treasure of wisdom for with wisdom one sees
the unmediated truth of life and the radiant truth of lasting joy in all circumstances.
Wide is the world and yet we seek to cut it and to confine it
and to create borders; wide is the mind and yet many seek
to constrict it and to set up boundaries and to restrict its space.
X
Avoid extremes in all matters – for it is it is the wisdom of moderation that universally promotes balance, health, happiness and calm.
Y
In one’s intellect let there be maturity and completeness and the wisdom of ages; but in one’s inquiry into life let there be vigor and newness and perennial youth.
Z
There are no confined zones in true love: love knows no boundaries and love knows no borders – the wide universe is the very home of love.
That inner peace radiates in the stars and in the trees  and in the grass; that inner peace radiates in the creatures of the earth and in  all living things and in the very air…That inner peace pervades all beings, all  life and all existence.And after the strife of this time,
Buried by the glory of the world to come.
Call of transfiguration will ho at us.
Death by then will flee from us.
Elation will be bethroted to us.
Friend of the immortal will we forever be.
18: 01: 01: 15: 16Incipit carmen secundum ordinem litterarum alphabeti.
Almighty and al merciable queene,
To whom that al this world fleeth for socour,
To have relees of sinne, of sorwe, and teene,
Glorious virgine, of alle floures flour,
To thee I flee, confounded in errour.
Help and releeve, thou mighti debonayre,
Have mercy on my perilous langour.
Venquisshed me hath my cruel adversaire.
Bountee so fix hath in thin herte his tente
That wel I wot thou wolt my socour bee;
Thou canst not warne him that with good entente
Axeth thin helpe, thin herte is ay so free.
Thou art largesse of pleyn felicitee,
Haven of refut, of quiete, and of reste.
Loo, how that theeves sevene chasen mee.
Help, lady bright, er that my ship tobreste.[Riv., p. 638]
Comfort is noon but in yow, ladi deere;
For loo, my sinne and my confusioun,
Which oughten not in thi presence appeere,
Han take on me a greevous accioun
Of verrey right and desperacioun;
And as hi right thei mighten wel susteene
That I were wurthi my dampnacioun,
Nere merci of you, blisful hevene queene.
Dowte is ther noon, thou queen of misericorde,
That thou n'art cause of grace and merci heere;
God vouched sauf thurgh thee with us to accorde.
For certes, Crystes blisful mooder deere,
Were now the bowe bent in swich maneere
As it was first of justice and of ire,
The rightful God nolde of no mercy heere;
But thurgh thee han we grace as we desire.
Evere hath myn hope of refut been in thee,
For heer-biforn ful ofte in many a wyse
Hast thou to misericorde receyved me.
But merci, ladi, at the grete assyse
Whan we shule come bifore the hye justyse.
So litel fruit shal thanne in me be founde
That, but thou er that day correcte [vice],
Of verrey right my werk wol me confounde.
Fleeinge, I flee for socour to thi tente
Me for to hide from tempeste ful of dreede,
Biseeching yow that ye you not absente
Thouh I be wikke. O, help yit at this neede!
Al have I ben a beste in wil and deede,
Yit, ladi, thou me clothe with thi grace.
Thin enemy and myn-- ladi, tak heede--
Unto my deth in poynt is me to chace!
Glorious mayde and mooder, which that nevere
Were bitter, neither in erthe nor in see,
But ful of swetnesse and of merci evere,
Help that my Fader be not wroth with me.
Spek thou, for I ne dar not him ysee,
So have I doon in erthe, allas the while,
That certes, but if thou my socour bee,
To stink eterne he wole my gost exile.
He vouched sauf, tel him, as was his wille,
Bicome a man, to have oure alliaunce,
And with his precious blood he wrot the bille
Upon the crois as general acquitaunce
To every penitent in ful creaunce;
And therfore, ladi bright, thou for us praye.
Thanne shalt thou bothe stinte al his grevaunce,
And make oure foo to failen of his praye.
I wot it wel, thou wolt ben oure socour,
Thou art so ful of bowntee, in certeyn,
For whan a soule falleth in errour
Thi pitee goth and haleth him ayein.
Thanne makest thou his pees with his sovereyn
And bringest him out of the crooked strete.
Whoso thee loveth, he shal not love in veyn,
That shal he fynde as he the lyf shal lete.
Kalenderes enlumyned ben thei
That in this world ben lighted with thi name,
And whoso goth to yow the righte wey,
Him thar not drede in soule to be lame.
Now, queen of comfort, sith thou art that same
To whom I seeche for my medicyne,
Lat not my foo no more my wounde entame;
Myn hele into thin hand al I resygne.
Ladi, thi sorwe kan I not portreye
Under the cros, ne his greevous penaunce;
But for youre bothes peynes I yow preye,
Lat not oure alder foo make his bobaunce
That he hath in his lystes of mischaunce
Convict that ye bothe have bought so deere.
As I seide erst, thou ground of oure substaunce,
Continue on us thi pitous eyen cleere!
Moises, that saugh the bush with flawmes rede
Brenninge, of which ther never a stikke brende,
Was signe of thin unwemmed maidenhede.[Riv., p. 639]
Thou art the bush on which ther gan descende
The Holi Gost, the which that Moyses wende
Had ben a-fyr, and this was in figure.
Now, ladi, from the fyr thou us defende
Which that in helle eternalli shal dure.
Noble princesse, that nevere haddest peere,
Certes if any comfort in us bee,
That cometh of thee, thou Cristes mooder deere.
We han noon oother melodye or glee
Us to rejoyse in oure adversitee,
Ne advocat noon that wole and dar so preye
For us, and that for litel hire as yee
That helpen for an Ave-Marie or tweye.
O verrey light of eyen that ben blynde,
O verrey lust of labour and distresse,
O tresoreere of bountee to mankynde,
Thee whom God ches to mooder for humblesse!
From his ancille he made the maistresse
Of hevene and erthe, oure bille up for to beede.
This world awaiteth evere on thi goodnesse
For thou ne failest nevere wight at neede.
Purpos I have sum time for to enquere
Wherfore and whi the Holi Gost thee soughte
Whan Gabrielles vois cam to thin ere.
He not to werre us swich a wonder wroughte,
But for to save us that he sithen boughte.
Thanne needeth us no wepen us for to save,
But oonly ther we dide not, as us oughte,
Doo penitence, and merci axe and have.
Queen of comfort, yit whan I me bithinke
That I agilt have bothe him and thee,
And that my soule is worthi for to sinke,
Allas, I caityf, whider may I flee?
Who shal unto thi Sone my mene bee?
Who, but thiself, that art of pitee welle?
Thou hast more reuthe on oure adversitee
Than in this world might any tonge telle.
Redresse me, mooder, and me chastise,
For certeynly my Faderes chastisinge,
That dar I nouht abiden in no wise,
So hidous is his rightful rekenynge.
Mooder, of whom oure merci gan to springe,
Beth ye my juge and eek my soules leche;
For evere in you is pitee haboundinge
To ech that wole of pitee you biseeche.
Soth is that God ne granteth no pitee
Withoute thee; for God of his goodnesse
Foryiveth noon, but it like unto thee.
He hath thee maked vicaire and maistresse
Of al this world, and eek governouresse
Of hevene, and he represseth his justise
After thi wil; and therfore in witnesse
He hath thee corowned in so rial wise.
Temple devout, ther God hath his woninge,
Fro which these misbileeved deprived been,
To you my soule penitent I bringe.
Receyve me-- I can no ferther fleen.
With thornes venymous, O hevene queen,
For which the eerthe acursed was ful yore,
I am so wounded, as ye may wel seen,
That I am lost almost, it smert so sore.
Virgine, that art so noble of apparaile,
And ledest us into the hye tour
Of Paradys, thou me wisse and counsaile
How I may have thi grace and thi socour,
All have I ben in filthe and in errour.
Ladi, unto that court thou me ajourne
That cleped is thi bench, O freshe flour,
Ther as that merci evere shal sojourne.
Xristus, thi sone, that in this world alighte
Upon the cros to suffre his passioun,
And eek that Longius his herte pighte
And made his herte blood to renne adoun,
And al was this for my salvacioun;
And I to him am fals and eek unkynde,
And yit he wole not my dampnacioun--
This thanke I yow, socour of al mankynde!
Ysaac was figure of his deth, certeyn,
That so fer forth his fader wolde obeye
That him ne roughte nothing to be slayn;[Riv., p. 640]
Right soo thi Sone list as a lamb to deye.
Now, ladi ful of merci, I yow preye,
Sith he his merci mesured so large,
Be ye not skant, for alle we singe and seye
That ye ben from vengeaunce ay oure targe.
Zacharie yow clepeth the open welle
To wasshe sinful soule out of his gilt.
Therfore this lessoun oughte I wel to telle,
That, nere thi tender herte, we were spilt.
Now, ladi bryghte, sith thou canst and wilt
Ben to the seed of Adam merciable,

Who’s to be blamed when things goes out wrong?
Who’s the culprit who messes up our song?
Who’s the author that governs this plight?
Who is he? Who is he? Who turns off the light?
Deprived of light and so we cannot see.
It’s only us who whirls the elese.
In our life’s ending, we hold the key.
Can’t we just drive and take it easy?
Coz I think to live life is so simple,
Doesn’t need to mix it up with trouble.
All you need is to sweeten up the flavor.
Then you’ll see your kissi’n up your neighbor.
Must kill, the undying love of hatred.
Declare war against envy and greed.
Imagine a world that lives in peace,
See the people spreading hug and kisses.
He says “remove vexation from your heart”.
Keep his word, walk tall and be smart.
You should live your life to the fullest,
Make the most of it before it’s too late.
I write this song as a reminder,
Coz our stay in here is not forever.
It’s inevitable, time just runs out,
So, go out of your shell and make a shout.
And my friend if in case you’re in trouble,
You should not worry you’ll just make it double.
One thing may help; wear a smile in your face,
Coz worrying wouldn’t’ add up your days.Crying for mama,
Desperation sets in.
Everywhere there's blood,
Far from home.
'Please, I don't want to die alone.'Um Mitternacht, das Schulhaus schlief,
Der Klassenraum war leer,
Da hörte man vom Schieferbrett,
Ein lautes: „Bitte sehr! ”
Sprach A zu B: „Ich hasse C!
Hat nicht mal Abitur!
Ich sehe von dem blöden C
den runden Rücken nur’! ”
„Dem ist nicht so! ” sprach D zu B,
„Ich sehe C nicht so!
In meinen Augen is das C
Ein rechtes, offenes O! ”
C war verwirrt: „Wie kann das sein!
Ich schillere in Chrom!
Wär’ anders ich, wo wären dann
Chirurg und Chromosom? ”
„Wie wahr, ” sagt’ E, dann F: „Ahah! ”
Und G fiel ein: „Ich seh’”
Verärgert räuspert sich das H:
„Vergiss mich nicht, mein G! ”
„Mach Platz! ” befahl das L dem K:
Der Koch fiel in das Loch.
Das war dem I und J nicht recht –
Sie spannten’s Loch ins Joch.
Nach einer Weile sprach das V:
„Das W wird nicht besteh’n!
Im alten Rom war V die Fünf,
Drum ist das W schon zehn! ”
Die Hexenstunde flog vorbei
An Ypsilon und Zett;
Sie gähnten laut und gingen dann
Zu schlafen in ihr Bett.
(nach: Spike Milligan: The ABC)Awkwardly they came and
Backwardly started,
Criminal, ruinous they are
Directly devil-like their figure,
Every ill and evil committers.

I know a lot of thing from ABC
Parent keep tell me to go school
Why should I when know my ABC's

From day to night
Parent keep tell me I could have had it better
If I went to school
I really don't know is school for me

Beginning to act frustrated and anxious.
Calling with howls of anger, piercing eyes glow.

In their struggle of conquer-and-divide.In the evening after tea
of bread and jam
and a glass of milk
you went out
and met Helen
under the railway bridge
in Rockingham Street
next to the Duke
of Wellington pub
and she was waiting
there looking up
and down the street
and when she saw you
she waved and walked
towards you
where's your doll
Battered Betty?
you asked
mum's washing her clothes
and I didn't want
to bring her out
with nothing on
she said
no that wouldn't be decent
you said
where are we going?
she asked
I want to show you
the passages behind
the ABC cinema
you said
it's like a cavern
of dark passages
and once I saw a rat
running along by a wall
oh god
she said
putting a hand
to her mouth
not a rat
yes it run along
one of the walls
not sure
I want to go there
she said softly
one little rat
isn't going to hurt you
you said
besides I'll chase it away
if it comes
will you?
she said
yes of course I will
nothing is going to harm you
while I am here
you said
you showed her
the toy gun
tucked in
the inside pocket
of your jacket
she nodded
and  she took
your hand
and you walked her
along and up behind
the Trocodero cinema
and onto
the New Kent Road
and you crossed quickly
before the traffic lights changed
and once you got
to the other side
you took her
to the ABC cinema
and went down beside
the cinema walls
along the dark passages
that went on beside
and behind the cinema
all the time
she gripped your hand
and now and then
her grip tightened
when she thought
she saw something
out of the corner
of her eye
what was that?
she said
stopping still
clutching your hand tight
just a piece of paper
blown by the wind
are you sure?
yes just paper
she untightened
her grip
and you both
walked on
with the sound
of traffic and voices
in the distance
and at the back
of the cinema
you came to an entrance
where two doors where
and you said
sometimes the doors are open
and you can sneak in free
she looked at you
her eyes behind
her thick lens glasses
large and innocent
is that allowed?
she asked
no
you replied
if they catch you
you get into trouble
but if you're lucky
you can get in
no trouble
you said
oh
she said
my mum wouldn't like it
if I got into trouble
we won't get in tonight
anyway
you said
the doors are locked
another time maybe
and she gripped
your hand
and her face looked shocked.Must admit, I learn many things from ABC

That too technical education after becoming so,
Manufactures products of degree holders sans no
Hope of future and knowledge to stand on one's legs!
Not knowing history and world's future, these technicians
Sans general knowledge too, don't know how to change
Their attitude and try their level best in some other line,
When the particular line of job becomes out of reach ever!
Caught in the quagmire, they become depressed due to
Their obsession and roam around as lunatics not knowing
Where they stand and where they have to go in this world
To achieve their aim and get fulfilment in the course of time!
Whatever be the education, it is just the ABC of language;
Using it with creative ability only, one can shine in any field!'Learning ABC'
A soft green carpet,
A rough darkened asphalt.
A carefree fall,
A cautious stroll.
Both have their reasons,
Can't choose just one.Allowing your way

Hey, what if my name is 'CDE'......Sometimes its the eyes and innocence of the young that enlightens.  If we adults would take the time to truly see through the eyes of innocence perhaps we can climb that beautiful mountain and reach the peak of happiness.

And every desk was shut
When suddenly from the alphabet
Was heard a loud "Tut-Tut!"
Said A to B, "I don't like C;
His manners are a lack.
For all I ever see of C
Is a semi-circular back!"
"I disagree," said D to B,
"I've never found C so.
From where I stand he seems to be
An uncompleted O."
C was vexed, "I'm much perplexed,
You criticise my shape.
I'm made like that, to help spell Cat
And Cow and Cool and Cape."
"He's right" said E; said F, "Whoopee!"
Said G, "'Ip, 'Ip, 'ooray!"
"You're dropping me," roared H to G.
"Don't do it please I pray."
"Out of my way," LL said to K.
"I'll make poor I look ILL."
To stop this stunt J stood in front,
And presto! ILL was JILL.
"U know," said V, "that W
Is twice the age of me.
For as a Roman V is five
I'm half as young as he."
X and Y yawned sleepily,
"Look at the time!" they said.
"Let's all get off to beddy byes."
They did, then "Z-z-z."I’m scared terrified beyond my worst nightmare
Alight with emotions raw and bare as the open soil just after ploughing
I don’t understand, can’t avoid-won’t admit
Boldness: lost and exchanged for involuntary bashfulness
I care for u-about your occasional cold, your state of mind everything: gosh-is it wrong to do so?
Carelessly I drift into a different world-one where light flashes across one’s face blurring logical reasoning
I like hearing from u-a mere “hi” sends my tiny heart fluttering above my head
Dare not: say a word for the tiny rope I hang onto would leave me timidly on the floor
I dream of having a full conversation with u: just to spend time enveloped in an atmosphere of tranquil
Eager beaver I am: yet I shudder to imagine such
I’d fidget around for a while: such is expected for flesh alone can’t carry the weight of feeling so
Flowing through my veins-my heart-my body: my being blood of passion
I feel like our souls are intoxicatingly bound by forces beyond our own control-playing us for fools
Grasping at invisible strands that keep us in control of what we don’t others to see
You are more than just an acquaintance, a companion an interest
Heaven-sent, sun-kissed, mind-blowing out of this world
You awaken parts within me: I’ve known never to exist Alas: my fickle heart
Idleness overpowered drowning in pools of confusion, losing the very essence of me
You have a power I wish I could take away: the influence-the strength aiding my helplessness
Just as a fledgeling surrenders to motherly nurturing: I depend
You are a dream that has evolved into reality
Kinder words I can’t express tongue-tied I’ve become
You are imperfectly you- drawing me closer to that which I refuse to surrender to
Let me be…for such I can’t handle-set I free break my chains
You hold the keys to happiness, deeper existence, worthwhile peace
A chest-full of secrets and answers
Magical, manipulative, melodious, mellow, miraculous, misunderstood, momentous, mortifyingly-merry, mythical LOVE CAN NOT BE FOR EVERYONE…SOME OF US FEEL THE NEED TO BE:
Free as the bird flying high-gazing upon mountains of flowers blossoming under the blazing sun Watching as creatures on the land toil away Foolish yet safe
As painful as it is: And forever it shall be: I sacrifice You-not because of selfishness, pity nor any fault But because I CARE GO on Break away- for I am not Brave enough! O  Sweet misery
(TO BE CONTINUED)Alone and hopeless in a world of woe,
By friends deceived, and spurned by many a foe,
Can man exist, and think, and act, nor feel
Despondency o'er all his being steal?
E'en faith in God and His all-gracious plan
Fails when we lack man's sympathy for man.
'Give us,' we cry, 'friends faithful and sincere—
Happy our present, and our future clear ;
In peace, oh God, our cups with plenty fill,
Join earth to heaven, all sin and sorrow kill;
Kill want and woe, then we shall gladly own
Love rules the earth, and God doth reign alone—
Mercy His crown, and Righteousness His throne!'
Nay, speak not so, it ill becomes a clod
Of lowly earth to dictate to his God !
Put down rebellion in thee, and no more
Question those gifts God poureth from his store.
Remember whence thou art, and whither bent ;
Say not 'tis evil which the Lord hath sent
To serve His gracious ends. He shall hold sway
Until each soul shall love him and obey.
Virtue brings peace. Seek her and thou shall find
What arms 'gainst griefs the philosophic mind.
Xantippe might scold, yet Socrates pursued,
Year in, year out, his philosophic mood—
Zealous for God, and for the cause of good.Aeroplane touches the land
Bustling noise fills the vacant
Circling some motion and emotion

Copyright © Muzahidul Reza| 5 December,2017Precambrian Era (4600 to 542.0 million years ago)
A permanent record of the Earth's past is marked by the
Boundaries of different layers of sedimentary rock which
Contains fossilized remains of plants and animals laid
Down over millions of years. Precambrian is the first of
Earth's geologic ages. The Precambrian age is by
Far the longest, starting 4.5 billion years ago. It is believed a
Global ice age was near its end causing extinctions of life that
Harnessed the sun's power through photosynthesis. This
Ice age may have may have changed the mix of a complex
Jackpot of multi-celled life-forms, with many that were
Killed off to start the Cambrian Period.
Levels of oxygen gradually climbed in the atmosphere from
Microscopic cyanobacteria, reaching about one percent
Nearly two billion years ago. About 800 million years ago,
Oxygen levels rose to about 21 percent (like today)   by
Photosynthesis from the cyanobacteria.
Quests to find out about this period have shown that the oxygen-
Rich ozone layer was also established which
Shields the Earth from harmful solar radiation.
This laid the groundwork to
Usher in the Cambrian and the rest of the Paleozoic with their
Various life forms.
Cambrian Period (542.0 to 488.3 mya)
A dramatic burst of evolutionary changes in life on Earth
Became known as the 'Cambrian Explosion.' Some resembled
Clams, and there were arthropods and chordates (animals with a
Dorsal nerve cord) . This period lasted about 53 million years of
Earth's history. The end of this period is marked by evidence in the
Fossil record of a mass extinction event about 490 million years ago.
Glaciers and a colder climate may have been the cause.
Ordovician Period (488.3 to 443.7 mya)
Algae and sponges dominated reef ecosystems and sometimes by
Bryozoans. However, there apparently were also periods of
Complete reef collapse due to global disturbances.
Diverse marine life was here, including graptolites, trilobites and
Early vertebrates, and brachiopods. There were also primitive
Fish, cephalopods, corals, crinoids, and gastropods, plus red and
Green algae. Tetrahedral spores similar to those of primitive land plants
Have been found, suggesting that plants invaded the land at this time.
Invertebrate genera and 25% of all families went extinct.
Silurian Period (443.7 to 416.0 mya)
About 443.7 to 416.0 million years ago was a time when many
Biologically significant events occurred. In the oceans, there were
Crinoids spreading widely and proliferation of the brachiopods.
Deglaciation and rise in sea levels created many new marine habitats.
Erratic climatic fluctuations ended for a time and coral reefs made their
First appearance during this time.
Devonian Period (416.0 to 359.2 mya)
All through the Devonian period, the seas were dominated by
Brachiopods, such as the spiriferids, and by tabulate and rugose
Corals, which built large reefs in shallow waters. In the Lower
Devonian, ammonoids appeared, leaving us large limestone deposits.
Echinoderms, graptolites, bivalves and trilobites were all present.
Forests spread, and complex root systems may have altered the
Global climate. Whatever the cause, the first vertebrates
Hobbled onto the land.
Carboniferous Period (359.2 to 299.0 mya)
Attached filter feeders such as fenestellids, a common type of
Bryozoans, were abundant in this environment, as were brachiopods.
Clams made their first appearance in freshwater, and there was
Diversity in sharks and an increase in gastropod and bony fish. The
Environment supported fewer corals, crinoids, cryozoans, and bryzoans.
Fluctuations in sea level can be seen in the rocks as striped patterns from
Glaciation. Sea levels dropped, leading to an increase in terrestrial
Habitat. As the continents moved closer to forming Pangea, there was an
Increase of marine life in those shallow continental waters.
Permian Period (299.0 to 251.0 mya)
'Age of Dinosaurs' is what this period is called after a mass extinction.
Brachiopods, ammonoids, fusilinids, and other marine invertebrates, and
Conodonts fossils occur within such specific time frames that strata are
Determined by them and permit stratigraphic identification. In the
Early Permian, it appeared that the snapsids were to be the animals
Found most on land, but later on, the sauropsid group were most when the
'Great Dying' occurred. In as little as 100,000 years of Earth's
History, the majority of living species on the planet were wiped out.
Investigations showed evidence of catastrophic volcanic activity that
Justifiably would have initially caused rapid global cooling and
Killing of many species, and leading to increased glaciations.
Lowered sea levels and volcanic fallout would account for
Marine ecosystems in collapse due to much higher levels of CO2,
Not in the air, but in the oceans.
Triassic Period (251.0 to 199.6 mya)
At the beginning of the Triassic, land masses of the world were still
Bound together into the vast supercontinent known as Pangea.
Climate of the Triassic Period was influenced by Pangea.
Due to the low sea level, flooding of the continents did not occur.
Elevation of the continents were high compared to sea level.
Forests in Luarasia in beginning Triassic were dominated by conifers;
Gondwana was dominated by Dicroidium and Thinnfeldia. By the end, both
Hemispheres gave way to conifer and cycad vegetation.
Inevitably the climate changed as the continents drifted apart.
Jurassic Period (199.6 to 145.5 mya)
Apatosaurus and many other dinosaurs roamed the land in the Jurassic.
Brachiosaurus was another huge one. Small, fast bird-like coelurosaurs,
Ceratosaurs (horned reptiles)   called Earth home. The famous
Diplodocus is a large long-necked Sauropod. Some plant life had
Evolved from Bryophytes, the mosses that lacked vascular tissue.
Floras were different from what we see today. Ferns, bennettitaleans,
Ginkgoes and cycads flourished in the Jurassic. Along with the large
Herbivores were some carnosaurs: Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex.
Ichthyosaurus was a fish-shaped reptile in the sea. In August 2011,
Juramaia was discovered by scientists in China. This tiny animal is
Kinfolk to placental mammals, so has caused excitement.
Cretaceous Period (145.5 to 65.5 mya)
At the time of the Cretaceous, many modern groups of insects were
Beginning to diversify, and we find the oldest known ants and butterflies.
Ceratopsian and pachycepalosaurid dinosaurs appeared then. Some
Dinosaurs that learned to fly included the pterosaurs and Confuciusornis.
Extensive new coastlines came about from the continents moving apart.
Forests with oaks, hickories, and magnolias became common.
Grasshoppers and gall wasps appear, as well as termites and bees.
Half of the world's species went extinct about the time an asteroid hit.
Invertebrates became extinct in what was clearly a climatic event.
Eocene Epoch (55.8 to 33.9 mya)
An early horse ancestor, the dawn horse, is among the fossils found in
Both North America and Europe in the lower Eocene rocks.
Cattle and sheep are some of the artiodactyls fossils found.
Deer is another, and perissodactyls include rhinoceroses and tapirs.
Eocene Epoch marks the first appearance in the fossil record of the
First elephant-like animals and the early bats. There were whales and
Gastropods (a class of mollusks containing snails, slugs, and limpets) .
Oligocene Epoch (33.9 to 23.03 mya)
As a result of the cooling trend, habitats were directly affected.
Biotic provinces became more fragmented as sea dwellers
Capable of cooler temps went further from the warmer equator.
Deer, camel, elephants, cats, dogs, and primates began to dominate,
Except in Australia. Migration occurred between continents.
Falcons, eagles, hawks, and many families of rodents appeared.
Grasses and composites increased in abundance globally.
Horses experienced a period of diversification.
Miocene Epoch (23.03 to 5.332 mya)
Africa and Eurasia encountered significant tectonic movement.
Beginning in mid-Miocene, there was warming, followed by a
Cooling. It is considered responsible for diversification of plant life.
Desmostylia and other ocean-going mammals went extinct.
Eurasia and Australia grew increasingly arid. Europe kept its moist
Forests. Antarctica became isolated from the other continents.
Global ocean and atmospheric circulation were affected by that.
Hoofed mammals underwent a period of rapid evolution.
Pliocene Epoch (5.332 to 2.588 mya)
Asia's and India's tectonic plates collided, forming the Himalayas.
Basin ranges of Nevada and Utah were uplifted along with the
Colorado plateaus. Armadillo, opossum, and porcupines went north.
Dogs, cats, bears and horses migrated south. The beginning of the
Epoch saw numerous fluctuations in temperature.
Forests were replaced by grasslands. This favored grazing animals.
Generally the climate is thought to have been much warmer than today.
Hot times were replaced with cold and polar ice caps started to develop.
Pleistocene Epoch (2.588 mya to 11,700 ya)
Alternately, temperate zones were covered and uncovered by glaciers
Because of dramatically shifting climates and temperatures.
Camels and horses galloped across the plains of North America.
Diatoms, foraminifera, and plant pollen, were both abundant.
Ever larger land mammals appeared such as mammoths and mastodons.
Flowering plants, insects, mollusks, birds and mammals survive to this day.
Great teratorn birds with 25-foot wingspans stalked prey.
Homo sapiens came about, and humans spread through most of the world.
Holocene Epoch (11,700 years ago to today)
Another name for the Holocene is the Anthropogene, the 'Age of Man.'
By 8000 B.C., the cultivation of wheat, etc. had spread from the Fertile
Crescent through much of the Indo/European world.
Domestication of sheep, goats and cattle began at about the same time.
Extinction of the 'mega-mammals' caused Humans to switch to
Far smaller game and agriculture for their food supply.
Genetic modification of food started, and now is almost exclusive.
Habitat destruction is the leading cause of species extinction today.
Improved sanitation and medical care caused death rates to decline.
Judicial decisions against the death penalty further increased population.
Killing of police officers is increasing, while birth rates continue to climb.
Limiting factors in the environment provide natural balances to populations.
Monoculture has affected the composition and fertility of the soil.
Nuclear power has had some catastrophes, but is still an important tool.
Oil drilling and refinement have led to high migration of humans and pets.
Populations are rising with few restrictions, and are exponential.
Quakes in the earth are getting more frequent. Fracking is suspected.
Racial clashes around the world are a source of destruction and migration.
Species gone extinct in the Holocene are counted as at least 171.
Transportation across oceans has spread viruses and bacteria globally.
Uranium enrichment can be good, but can be the way to mass extinctions.
Virus mutations have led to super-viruses that are immune to antibiotics.
War has been the cause of mass migration, and smoke affecting climate.
X-rays save lives by alerting to medical problems that can be solved.A

As per a request, I choose hockey, Canada's game as the theme
And begin by saying that 1994, our first year in Canada, the Toronto Maple Leafs were big
Although Auston Matthews was not even born then
As my own 19 year old son (turns 20 in another 5 weeks)was not a part of our world
Aptitude for a certain play, Art of the game, Aspirations for a career oriented life figured on my list of wishes;
Beautiful was I with my, many a time,
Brazen bold seduction of my husband
Breasts I had as a natural asset and in retrospect, I think
Ballsy was I despite the shyness I had
Becquerels of radioactivity did the two of us emit, Batting of eyelids could I be accused of, Best was I at homemaking and study;
C Programming and math was the name of the game in Spring 1994
Canada it was from then on for we had moved from Phoenix, USA
Cuddling after with a cigarette smoke, dearest, you got a biscuit in the basket to satisfy the Sexaholic in me
Could it be even fathomed that your playing above the Red Line sometimes-days were over
Condom happy, I never let you be a winger
Could it be otherwise possible at the net end for it was a sniper for you at all times
Call it the perks of homemaking, we played for the same team
Characterwise - you were the Pepper Pot who lingered in the rink, Conductwise - you did not need a Jock for I was gentle and loving in my sucking of your manhood, Caresseswise - you had me at the first suck of my tongue or my breasts for I, as the momma hide the cookies in the top shelf;
Do I make the rounds today as the Shopaholic
Dollars I must spend, for a few more would not make a big hole in my purse
Daywise, it would be simply beautiful to go to the Hockey Hall of Fame gift store
Delightful was our visit to the main museum some years ago
Dillydally will I when I make a purchase for myself, Dashing will my son look in a CANADA jersey
DaddyO has the edge when it comes for a family outing;
Effective was my painting of Auston Matthews getting the puck in as a Workaholic
Educated should I become in the details of the hockey world
"Evermore Nevermore"
Escher could not boast of as fine a theme in a painting
Elitist would I be if I were erudite in the ways of hockey or even the NHL, Effortless it seems despite the sweat dripping from their faces, Esther Williams effect would I have on the entire world if I were to enter the hockey arena in a swimsuit;
LUCKY am I as the Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic
Loving and Loved
Understanding and Understood
Cultured and Cute
Knowledgeable and Keen
Yesteryears-wise, mostly happy AND Yours Truly, my dear husband and beloved son, in the years to come.Aye I call you a pig and hog! Don’t worry same
Blood flows in me – Inhumane, my name I
Change and mood each time anew – A-bomb
Dingbat, bouncing-betty, Gelignite, ragsorter’s
Explosive, c4 plastic as I’m so materialistic;
Food I eat with automatic hand, just a stick
Geez! Some proteins and Vitamins inward
Hey! I push but result is a fat round belly outward
ira! All are trained idiots & cultured apes, is not a
Jeering tag as we forget all in the world is transient;
KO, my life is gone hither and thither, in water a
Literary splitter-splatter, and die in living.Accomplished verse must whizZ
Zestfully forwards as imagination's fleA
Bites author's itchy fingers. Cells greY
Yearn to coin expressions. Gift of gaB
Crafts timeless phrases which waX
Xanadu with Coleridge nectar, emotive gamut pedantiC,
Devise surprising riddles whose fair floW
Will appeal to all who reaD
Empathetic intellect must reV
Vers libres, prose or traditional versE,
Free or formally structured, before life says adieU.
Unlimited possibilities, both flexible and stifF
Glow, grow and encourage lighT
Themes, weighty arguments, or emotional sonG,
Heavy here, light there, unpretentiouS.
Sure instinct stimulates inner growtH.
Insight, acting as an intellectual spuR,
Rewards readers and writer where not restricted to the 'I'.
Judgemental values shed from Zimbabwe to IraQ.
Quest for immortality, perceived as holy hadJ,
Karmic grail, is accorded toP
Priority for life's boat that sooner or later springs a leaK,
Leaving little to survive Lethe's oblivion shampoO
Or inspire others to saiL
Manfully upon seas uncharted by other men or womeN.
New forms in themselves add no gleaM
Native to poetry, often lose steaM,
Marred by inaccessibility. Experiments abecedariaN
Or atonal contemporary 'e-zines' under whatever vanity labeL
Leave much to be desired, their quality is frequently toO
Poor to last, too topical, too obscure, or too darK.
Keep in mind that the poet's creative leaP -
Quest, or self-centred search for memorial TaJ
Jehan - longs to build in verse or prose colloQ
Remains elusive to all using writing as an existential alibI
Ineffective at hiding inadequacy. Flaw and erroR,
Self-defeating, never stay the course, double bogey their entH
Half-hearted drive towards proverbial Elysian green pastureS.
Thus, whole unwon not hole in one. Keats' 'eternal longinG'
Goes phut, stutters, stumbles, falls, fails forgotten, inspiration cuT,
Undone ambitions, pointless lemming clifF.
Final verdict left to self-styled critics acting in lieU,
Vainly attempt to catch Fame's eyE,
Efforts dissipated, meeting the same fate as BrezhneV
Whose invasion of Afganistan leaD
Directly to Soviet collapse. Poetry represents harmonic undertoW

Zealous bigot not her cup of teA,
Before accepting Mr. Y
Years eight and eighty, not a deB,
Could nor with him nor Mr. X,
Xanax share, they weren't pneumatiC.
Decided that Mr. W
Was far too fat, had a big heaD,
Ended that and turned to  Mr. V
Viagra prized more than virtuE.
Found naught in common with Mr. U
Unkempt, distraught and very stifF
Gladly told him so and lefT
To an appointment with Mr.G -
His voice was raucous, spectacleS
Shady, of uncertain healtH,
Insensitive, an arrant cuR,
Ready to furnish alibI.
Judged him too seedy. Mr. Q
Questions refused to answer.  Mr. J
Knew little, so she lost no sleeP,
Perplexedly, lost, in the darK.
Little Miss French called Mr. O
Of Bury St. Edmonds, and, bad girL
Made eyes, flirting with other meN
Now here now there as Cupid's aiM,
Netted another victim, SaM:
Most unfortunately Sam loved BeN,
Or was it Harry PercevaL,
'Life's full of surprises', she said, 'whO
Prepares for doomsday earthquake cracK? '
Kind lady then turned to Mr P
Queried his clothes, while Mr. J.
Just turned her down for some Miss Q
Rebuttal neither you nor I

A bird in heart usually sings for the whole lifetime
Being cheered by the secret soul does fly,
Ceremonies go on time to time
Developing or getting demotion the soul's cry,
Every season offers much charm and time
Forever for utilizing the chances properly and to apply,
Goes on singing short or long
Hour after hour the moments remind sillily;
Important parts should be kept in vital time
Judging self deeds, songs rhythmically,
Keeping equilibrium as ages pass from life
Life is not a whim or for one not many,
Miles after miles only its dimension
No way to escape, anyway;
Often harm can come from wrong direction
Protecting that to paradise one may find out the way;

Rarely occult happens think many,
Singing goes on in bird's life standing, sitting or lying
Time to time rhythms change automatically;
Universal points are moving on line

Where none will have any question or objection

A mono syllabic word
Beginning and journeys start from the soul period
Center is the earth,
Duties start on from this temporary center
Ends in hereafter with entering heaven or hell,
Formally every phase is the most significant
Goal and success depend on this central deeds
How and what are done? (Of good and bad) ,
In all stages from center to end,
Journeys and stations it should introspect
Kindling exactly, after all
Longing for the absolute goal;
Meaningful should be, I say, must be its target
Nowhere it should be free from good activities,
Off time should be full of duties
Personal choices are valueless,
Quite solid, straight, curve, hard and easy paths
Respective liking here is very important,
So, let's attempt to reach its goal
To be really successful,
Universal and universality are great points
Vary varied these measurements! Why?
Worldwide waves the truth
X (a measured letter)free there is nothing,
Year after year goes life
Zero its main bag found ultimately! Why?Last night I dreamed hard;
A man shaped wind walked past me
Changed his mind, returned
Feel his mind wonder
Haven't I seen you before?
I sleep-laugh-out-loud..!
The noise wakes me up
Night clock reads three thirty three
I fall back to sleep
Head first tumble up
A leaf wafted from my tree
Caught on a stray breeze

Unsettled slumbering sighs
Nocturnal vision

Plucked from our common dream-scape

Handle your business in the
Indigo yonderDeep in the darkest part of your heart
Every beat seems to be a trying slow start
Pride and victory have no place here
Reasonable thoughts are placed on the back burner
Every breath  difficult and heavy
Seasons all remain the same, cold, dark and gloomy
Stereotypical behaviour is quite apparent
In the quiet darkness you reside
On a deep running  slow train
Never, yes it never seems like you’ll come back again
Written:  Jan.18,2008Living in a blissful, happy state,
Over the rainbow, my true love waits.
Vibrant, strong, yet tender to touch.
Elegant she stands, I love her so much.
Written:  Jan.12,2008Lying beside you,  watching you sleep.
Owning the moment, I began to weep.
Vigor and zest you possess with flare.
Everlasting love together we’ll share.
Written:  Jan.12,2008Loving you feels like the soft touch of velvet rain.
Over the hills we’ll walk together again.
Violet eyes, ruby lips, a beautiful smile.
Every step a blessing walking down the aisle.
Written:  Jan.12,2008Love lives in the night sky.
Opening it’s arms, caressing you and I.
Veils and ribbons suspended above.
Every moment shows signs of our true love.
Written:  Jan.12,2008Love creates a sensual stream, intensifying all romantic dreams.
Over  picturesque  landscapes, hills and mountains high.
Victoriously seen through a  keen mind's  eye.
Every electrifying moment captured inside.
Written:  Jan.14,2008In the landscape of your mind, one has the ability to think clearly.
Never allowing deep, dark thoughts to penetrate.
Spirited, beautiful and heavenly thoughts tickle the senses.
Piercing through delicate walls,  giving strength to stand  tall.
Instead of accepting negative views from those of low self esteem.
Realize you are in charge of every thought held within.
Always start each day in a positive light.
Thinking, of God’s wondrous gifts, His beauty in sight.
In the quiet of the noon day sun,   a new day has begun.
On top of  mountains high, sitting calmly while  birds fly by.
Never leaving  your mind untouched by God’s beauty.
Always covered like a glove,  by the blood of the lamb.
Live, love, laugh stay protected, in the palm of His glorious hand.
Written:  Feb.9,2008Pining for a much better quality of life,
Opened to great suffering and pain.
Violence and hate, society's distain.
Every step seems a step in the wrong direction.
Realizing each day is a losing battle.
Trampled by the powerful, frowned upon by middleclass.
Yet always wondering, how long will it last.
Written:  Jan.15,2008Being with family is best part,
real world to spend meaningful life;
and it is when you feel at home...
to mingle with people you love.
Family is the basic unit
and the foundation of society.
making peace and unity at home,
is the secret of a progressive community.

yearning for a happy family is to make it happened.Happy Graduation Day to you!
At last you've completed this journey.
Preparing for a long time you've
Pursued what you've dreamed for and now
You are going on your way up
Greater things are waiting for you and
Really you are on your way now
And there's a more in the future for you to do and your
Dad and your mom must be very proud of you
Use your talents well and be the best you can be, remember
All that you have done to get where you're now
This is not the end but it's just the beginning for you so
Inspire others you meet on your way out to do the same and
Open the door of your heart and
Never quit dreaming but hold on tight to your hopes 'cause
Day after day there are more things to do and learn
And remember to be honest and true to you because...
You can make all your dreams come true one day too
Happy Graduation Day to you!
August 23,2009A prisoner of your love. I stand behind four walls of gray.
- Alone; your memory my only company, each solitary day.
Locked down; twenty four hours around the clock, without you near.
- Living dreams of the past it seems, are all that I hold dear.
Constantly and always there, memories of you flow through the air.
- Constantly reminding me of our love. That we no longer share.
A prisoner of your love. Can I do the time? That's my only fear.
- And now the echo's of my lonely heart are the only sounds I hear.
Trapped; in this cinder block room. Shadows of gloom are here to stay.
- Trapped here without your love, as my blood turns prison gray.
Release may never come to me. This cell's become my home you see.
- Reliving how things used to be, in this gray walled penitentiary.
Alcatraz; is where I dwell. Where these gray walls are my living hell.
- Although one day escape I may. Right now's too soon to tell.
Zenith's, I know our love had reached. I'll love you still as time goes on.
- Zealously i'll wait for thee on ''The Rock''; till my last breath is gone..

"Nor forget, my good fellow to send her beside

Under the starry sky's, they lived off the land.
Storms, droughts and fires
Throughout the millenniums
Ravished the land, but they survived.
According to their culture
Loyal to the land they remained
Ignoring all the ill they endured from the white
Aborigines have not yet lost the fightBUTTERFLY
As born with Spring, with roses born away,
Breasting breeze’s wing to swing on high,
Upon bright buds’ breasts balanced, trembling play,
To drink and drown in perfume, light and sky.
To dust wings’ powder while still young and spry;
Earth flee, fly like a sigh the Milky Way, -
Rare fate, enchanted, of the Butterfly!
Fli[r]t, restless, like Desire, by night and day,
Loving all things, who none may satisfy,
Yearn ecstasy? - then seek in Heaven, .... good-bye!

IIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIII
PAPILLON
Naître avec le printemps, mourir avec les roses,
Sur l’aile du zéphyr nager dans un ciel pur;
Balancé sur le sein des fleurs à peine écloses,
S’enivrer de parfums, de lumière et d’azur;
Secouant, jeune encor, la poudre de ses ailes,
S’envoler comme un souffle aux voûtes éternelles;
Voilà du papillon le destin enchanté:
Il ressemble au désir, qui jamais ne se pose,
Et sans se satisfaire, effleurant toute chose,
Retourne enfin au ciel chercher la volupté.
Extrait de “Méditations” Alphonse de Lamartine 1790_1869
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICaptivated, by your love and charms. I shall always be.
~~ Can't wait to hold you in my arms. You are everything to me.
Always there, you are on my mind and deep within my heart.
~~ Always knew that I needed you. Right from the very start.
Pretty as a picture, you are a vision of loveliness.
~~ Pleasing is this gift of love, that we now possess.
Tears of joy you bring to me. With each passing day.
~~ Tears '' only of happiness '' are all that flow my way.
In every waking moment. I find that you are always on my mind.
~~ In every way I am thankful, for our love that's so divine.
Virtually our love has blossomed, fulfilling my every need.
~~ Viable is how our love has grown, from the smallest seed.
All of heavens stars shine down, upon the wonder of our love.
~~ All love's treasure beyond measure. 'Twas sent from up above.
The love we have grown. This love we now own, it shall always stay.
~~These feelings that I feel today, shall never go away.
Every time I hold you in my arms. I know that our love is true.
~~ Each breath that I take asleep or awake, 'tis for only you.
Darling listen to me as I hold you in my arms. It's you that I adore!
~~ Deeply; I am captivated by your love and will be - for evermore...

Poem In double acrostic -Real deal don’t simply come through,
Only a zealous act can make it true.
Can not cease on one or two successes,
Heed to what your innate desire focuses.
Expend all the opportunities at hand,
Let your candid charm grabs it all with fond.
Life is an open arena for whatever you yearn,
Every victory you get is worth the train.
Onward to venture and accomplish more,
Conquer boundaries while you explore.
Our support for you bear no bore.Clues
Orbit
Nightly in
Concentric dreams.
Ellipses  carry
Notes and nuance beyond
The limits of inner space.
Revolving glimmers coalesce
In overlapping lucent circles.
Clues orbit nightly in concentric dreams.Pain, is my life
Optimist, is my sight
Evil, is my breath
Missory, is my hope
Heart, is my strength
Useless, is my worth
Nothingness, is my soul
Torn, is my thought
Elusive, is my spirit
Remorse, is my loveDoctors are a noble lot
Often misunderstood, a slot
Caring for the sick and dying
They comfort the anguished and crying
One true noble profession, world envies
Really doing yeoman service
Sacrificing precious time for patients’ sake
Demanding not much in return
Always ready to save lives
Yet, the world seems dissatisfied!

A-tremble spreads its balm upon the evening air
Revealing perfumed calm and background sounds full fair
In waltz-mode stately-sad and langour’s dizziness
At last to spead its balm upon the evening air –
Music from violin as in heart sorely pressed.
A waltz-mode stately-sad and humour hard oppressed.
My sky, too, beauty-sad, as altar dressed for prayer.
A violin soft sings heart burden hard to bear,
Replies to tender soul detesting emptiness,
It echoes sad sky nigh, yet like an altar dressed,
As sun drowns, set in blood, blood-red, sere, set, see there!
May tender heart be guessed that dark night does destest,
Although of lost past’s light each remnant’s traced with care.
Drowning sun, set in blood, reflections everywhere,
Draws your portrait for me, a sacred relic blessed.

Chaque fleur s’évapore ainsi qu’en encensoir;
Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l’air du soir;
Valse mélancolique et langoureux vertige!
Chaque fleur s’évapore ainsi qu’en encensoir;
Le violon frémit comme un coeur qu’on afflige;
Valse mélancolique et langoureux vertige!
Le ciel est triste et beau comme un grand reposoir.
Le violon frémit comme un coeur qu’on afflige;
Un coeur tendre, qui hait le néant vaste et noir!
Le ciel est triste et beau comme un grand reposoir.
Le soleil s’est noyé dans son sang qui se fige.
Un coeur tendre, qui hait le néant vaste et noir!
Du passé lumineux recueille tout vestige!

Ton souvenir en moi luit comme un ostensoir!

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHe gave forgiveness for all who repent
In His great Mercy paid it all at Calvary
Sacrificed so perfect,  Grace touched you and me.
How can one receive the Gift so pure?
Each one can take it from His Word
All who turn away from sin are sure
Love and peace His Grace pours forth
In all of that He reigns as LORD
New creations only He can promise
God is Faithful and He will do this.
God gives new life as you turn to Him
Restoration and healing He alone can give
Almighty and eternal is your God within
Christ said you will not perish but eternally live.
Everything God said is true...so believe!Hallowed be the time before Halloween was the first day of Christmas
Alleluia to the day when Carols did not play
Prior to Thanksgiving
Perhaps you remember it, to me it seems like only
Yesterday such was the rule.
How did we allow
Our priorities to change
Letting commerce lead the way
In deciding the final say
Delivering up the season
Against our better judgement
Yielding to the pressure of
Salesmen and Advertisements
Maybe we lost our way
Even without knowing
Ready to jump at the chance to
Run after ever more accumulations
Yet never having enough
Can you really say you are
Happier now then when the
Real spirit of Christmas
Inspired more than just
Spending or
Taking, and the true
Meaning of Christmas was
As clear as a
Silent night with one brilliant StarHomework is such a bore
Others never do it
M y parents make me
Everyday I get a ton
Way to much to get done
Occasionaly I have none
Really though, I’ll get the teachers back
Knock some sense into themDull grey cabinets, posters on the wall,
Overalls in grubby white passing through the hall,
Stretcher beds, beige, blue, seating for a few,
The white welcome posts do duty all year through.
Awaiting diagnoses, anxious patients call,
Yet information filters slowly, at a crawl.
Patience, a virtue, tried and tested too,
Applies elastic strings to Time, judgements askew.
Through age, illness, accident, Death nets all.
Independence? – truly few retain the wherewithal.
Every day brings query, quandary adds to
New isolation, illness, tests as wills unglue.
Count all your blessings, be life fine or squall,
Each soon accounts must render, with Death’s pall.I will stand by you until; the sands of time, stand still -
Without you my world would just crumble and fade away
It is heaven when I hold you, each embrace is such a thrill
Lost in thoughts of you, your on my mind both night and day
Love like ours I am thankful for and I pray our love will stay
Standing by your side I shall, in sunshine or in rain
Through my life '' I will stand by you '' there I shall remain
As our love grows, like the pretty flowers do in spring
Never ending perfumed bouquets of love, to you I'll bring
Divine is our romance, to me your love means everything
Being with you my angel, I've shed only happy tears
Your loves a part of me, that I'll treasure through the years
You are all I ever longed for my paradise of dreams, it seems
Only your love could bring this all about. I will stand by you
Until the last grain of sand, in the hourglass of time runs out

Over the tall pine-trees and thick foliage,
Uniting the clouds from above
Naturally, and blocking the visual acuity of
The tired, trekking mountaineers on their
Arduous route down the mountain slopes,
In the intense heat of the rising sun,
Notwithstanding the many
Miles of shrubs and undergrowth that lie ahead, looking
Impossible to even the expert climber, who is momentarily
Relieved and excited by the mirage of an old castle
Appearing suddenly from nowhere,
Giving a ‘de ja vu’ feeling to all up there
Eyeing the beauty of the ancient masonry.

Become my loving sweetheart that we may
Entwine like twisting vine or eglantine,
More closely grow together every day?
You ask me why I love you as I do,
Vain would it be were I to try to list
All thousand things that make you specially you:
Lips like twin lotus buds just made to kiss,
Eyes clear and still like pools in which I lose
No time but dive within to sink or swim,
To lose all sense of time and place. I choose
In tenderness to meet your every whim,
No matter what you wish I’ll gladly do
Except give up, or go, or be untrue.You love your motherland –
One, where you were born and nurtured in
Unknown ways, most miraculously.
Love your Motherland with heart and soul;
Only your own country is the safest for you;
View its landscape, gorgeous and beautiful;
Every fellowman is your brethren.
You must be proud of its rich heritage;
One shouldn’t forget how freedom was got;
Unite against forces that separate;
Repay your country’s love by sacrifice.
May be, your country is not very rich;
Only its culture is so remarkable;
Traditions must be followed with pride;
Honor your national flag;
Every citizen is duty-bound;
Religions shouldn’t serve to foment fights;
Love the soil that feeds you all through life;
Astound the world by your patriotism;
Nothing’s more sacred and valuable than your Motherland;
Die, if need be, for your country’s sake!

Thus what once anticipation seemed probation turns as, schooled,

Marred by nation renovation bars, or scars with strict surround

Though new cycle spins unpin past wins while progress must address

Time
Time, the master of the master, can the slave of slave become,
in a twinkling of an eyelid, with an inkling of the mind;
most can only fall, and falling must capsize, and thus we find
every grief has silver lining, retribution soon will come.
Time, the tortoise of the fable, pride and greed will overcome.
Is it justice? Is it balance? Those in front soon fall behind,
making room for fresh proposals, new ideas, which, less confined,
express the need for further progress, granting voices to the dumb.
Time destroys its own foundations then rebuilds by rule of thumb,
intuition finds the pattern that intelligence devined;
mankind must press forwards quickly or its mainspring will unwind,
ever onwards, tripping, hasty, in a vicious spiral-scrum.
Time the tempter and preemptor auctions choices - gubble-gum
into emptiness exploding, in a vacuum Lethe-lined,
mirage is Man’s desert sojourn, he who on false dreams has dined
entertains high expectations which too soon prove void and numb.
Time, an excellent musician, is the drummer and the drum,
is the pot as well as potter, is the watch it keeps to wind
mortality, makes mockery of the motives of mankind,
ends emotions, - love, hate, passion, - is the swimmer and the swum.
Time, the predator and dater, turns the bread of life to crumbs,
ices in a trice Life’s waters, hopes as dust are redfined;
mem’ry may be a magician but the pyramids remind
each mortal that his pomp and pow’r an hour lasts, then must succumb.
10 December  1990I took a Rosebud from a certain bower,
And by its side placed an Orange flower,
Then with the Speedwell, blended the perfume
And the sweet beauty of an Apple-bloom,
And thus, 't is one of the loveliest feats,
Is spelled a gentle lady's name in sweets.Unexpected is this strange transition,
K.G.B. and C.I.A. destroyed, -
Remnants of a world which once enjoyed
A game of catch as catch can coalition.
Idea[l]s are bent beyond all recognition,
New capital’s towards the East decoyed,
Enterprise unbridled, unalloyed:
Uncertain is Man’s future, world in fission.
Kiev opportunity:  ambition
Rises with the rate that unemployed
Are added to the rolls.  Few will avoid
Impending challenge, fewer have volition.
Now, with the New Year knocking on the door,
Expect in time change none have dreamed before.
1 December 1991Victory to all hearts at love;
Amazing words of love exchange;
Love fills the air everywhere;
E-mails sent in lovely hues and tones of love;
No one’s exempt from love’s phenomenon;
The whole world celebrates ‘lover’s day, ’
In gaiety, romanticism and togetherness;
No one need covet persons at love;
Every person needs a lovely time;
’
Say, ‘I love you’ to someone, if you can.
Dance and sing to tunes of love;
Awaken emotions in Cupid’s style;
You are a valentine on earth to someone!
Copyright by Dr John Celes 2-13-2009Memories woven to monument towering to heaven
Of a sweet, gracious and wonderful woman.
Though she did nothing wrong, she was persecuted
Held daughter and son in arms, her man was deported.
Edgy at the brickyard, hurt in Jewish pride
Rascals put her in a jammed freight car for a railway ride.
Weary from thirst and hunger, surrounded by pain
Horror was unfolding on a rattling train.
Exhausted of the ordeal she arrived at the camps
Robbed of her freedom she stood under the lamps
Exposed to blowing snow, the barracks lacked ovens.
A small vulnerable woman there had seen forehand
Ruthless degradations, beastly atrocities offhand.
Experienced nightmare while the sun was shining
Yet hope knocked the door when bombs were falling.
Overwhelmed by explosions, frightened, panic-stricken
Unprotected against the blasts, she shielded her children.Water is my favourite drink,
At times the best thing to quench a thirst
That comes to me suddenly,
Even though it's abundantly available
Refined, pure specimens are sold in shops.Acrostic poetry

Relaxing to the mind!
In times of stress, in times of need,
To help you to unwind!
In truth, the pen is mightier!
No doubt at all in this...
God knows our meanings must be clear
Succinct won't go amiss!
A gentle word, a piece of prose,
Triumphant themes and more,
Opinions sought, meant to propose,
Not easy to ignore!
I've done my part, this much is true...
Calligraphy's now up to YOU!My dreams stood naked, behind the burning desire
Unbidden treasures appeared,bidding for my life:
Enthusiasm gained momentum, wearing golden attire,
And the moon reappeared, by piercing the clouds bizarre.My love is pure as honey, made of selective nectars
A work in tandem by bees, taking the sorrows of my life:
Some buried petals of the past mixed with the fragrance of presence,
weaving the relationships; by the threads of words.'Twas the morning of Palm Sunday, in Village Adair,
And the shy little chapel seemed jubilant there;
'Twas the morn of Palm Sunday, sad Sunday, I ween,
That I met thee and loved thee, Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!
I stood by the pew that was nearest to thine,
While gentle St. Agnes, just over the shrine,
Yearned tenderly to thee, as if she had seen
Thy face up in Heaven, Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!
I remember thy bodice, so snowy and blest,
With a violet guarding its virginal nest;
Thy sensitive forehead, thy contour serene,
And a ripple of ringlets, Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!
We met in the aisle — how I think of it now! —
And meekly I tendered my sanctified bough.
'Twas fondled, thy darling, deft fingers between —
Ah! the poor bough is withered , Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!
And withered am I by a pitiless doom,
Like a blast from the lungs of the demon simoom;
In the magical spell of a haunted ravine,
Dost thou hear when I call thee, Alexandrine?
Alexandrine!
On my cheek there is health, all my mind is aglow,
But my soul is the saddest Sahara I know;
For thought hath not compassed, and eye hath not seen
The kingdom I'm banished from, Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!
By the way of the cross gleams thy radiant crown;
By the way of the world all my dreams have gone down:
For thee peace and mercy; for me daggers keen,
And war with the wehr-wolf, Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!
Thy sorrows were many, thy happy days few;
Thy tears bowed thee down like a rose crushed with dew;
But those tears were too precious for mortal to glean,
And a bride of the sky art thou, Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!
In a dim convent cell of a land far away,
Thy crucifix guides thee by night and by day;
And the white wings of seraphim flutter between
My eyes and thy holiness, Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!
In thy saintliest prayer I would ask to remain,
Though for me there be no resurrection again.
The stars in their courses have mocked me, my queen,
But I bless thee forever, Alexandrine,
Alexandrine!Alexandrine, a wisely poem form
Twelve diphthongs in each of twelve lines
Major stresses are given on the sixth diphthong
And on the last one
And one secondary accent in each of half line,
Some alternatives are found
In case of no stresses on the last diphthong
Then thirteen diphthongs need in that line
Line is often called an alexandrine;
Originally, in French prosody, there is a twelve diphthong meter
And in English, here is iambic hexameter;
The rhyme scheme is a a b b (heroic alexandrine)
Or, a b a b (elegiac alexandrine)
With obligatory alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes;
In Russian poetry, iambic hexameter with a caesura
After the third foot
And with rhyme scheme of a a b b
And alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes;
In French, rhyming couplets of two alexandrines
Are of equal length, usually containing four accents,
Having been the classic poetic form
Since the time of Ronsard;
The form named, ‘Alexandrine'
Might drive from the fact that
Some poems of 12th and 13th century about Alexander the Great
Were written in this meter.
Copyright © Muzahidul Reza │19 January,2018An English Alexandrine
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
From Wikipedia and the internet, an iambic is an unstressed syllabic word followed by a long or stressed syllabic word. If an iambic hexameter is accompanied by a caesural (a pause to make sense)and rhyme, it is an Alexandrine. Please note: The character, /, denotes a caesural in my poem.
My heart would be broken, alas! / if PM Justin Trudeau
Were to not fulfill his promise, go against his apparently spoken word
And I would scale new heights of fame
And gain more of a name, I hope, in the artist's and writer's world and without a doubt, the engineer's world if he were to keep his word;
Mr. Prime Minister, I ask of you if I am on the Green Meridian Road
Having donned the maple leaf of viridian hue as a daily flowery garb since Jan 1994
Embroidered with roses as leaves, for if one rose in my life decides the median
The other rose, be that it may/ calculates the mean;
If I am positive, Canada feels pride in my achievements
There may be prejudice against the fact that my published work while special
Has not been published presentations and I find it difficult to swim against this tide of bureaucracy
And I wish for justice in my direction/, a fair granting of earnings;
There, I used the two abstract nouns in relative conjunction as Jane Austen had,
And since I watched the Hollywood versions of both Pride and Prejudice AND Persuasion without abstraction of thought,
I most certainly do not agree that at times, ‘'yielding to persuasion'' does not show ‘'feebleness of character''
In many ways, it shows vision against division in society;
Surely, I am making this poem take a serious bent of mind
And if a man in one's life is a find
Then since, one has to conform to the epithet of a feminist, / gentle persuasion from my side
Must be accompanied by missions which one completes;
On a relevant aside, I must mention Nick Hornby's book, Funny Girl, which is in tune with my taste thus far
In which a side character's wife, June, would have cried after their second episode of marital sex
And in passing, I thought that I like sex with my husband
Since it is a mix of the humdrum and the exotic and will always tell him with a straight face that I saw a thousand stars come together in a flash;
But it so happens that I also liked sex with other attractive, eligible and forthcoming men
However I swear that I am a one man woman also very much in love with my husband
But the snag with marital fidelity is that
The engineer-artist-painter-writer-poet in oneself does not get richer;
So to all those men out there, men in high places in engineering,
I offer a deal which comes with a to-die-for-face and natural big breasts and other attributes,
That along with considerable honest work from me with considerable pay from you
There comes a secret alliance, a sexual union, an offer from me, away from home
And this must be a home based project
And not a paid position
For my job prospects and resume and references are good.Your love for me a little more than nothing means,
When love as sense of self may be, than mine, less strong.
The thrill of love may keep its paint on withered greens.
A night of dreams is like a sad and jerking song.
Your silence dances meaning’s words on face’s frown,
My eyes of winter watch the stream of light on high,
Emotions are a flow of words, while stripping down
Their sense of love to sound like a sad ‘’good bye’’.
With red unfolded kisses thrilling white delight,
The moon replaces missing sun with all around.
It makes me dance my will  in dreams’ abstract on height.
It makes me feel the love again and heals my wound.The earth speaks of your discerning and stern glory:
Speaking the language human couldn't comprehend:
The wind telling the leafs to go on pilgrimage,
The leafs in turn taking picnic on the tried earth.
The waves flee at the pronouncement of your great name:
even that name that breaks through every generations.
Like the calf does everest flee at your presence,
Afraid of the entourages preceeding you.
The wind howl at your order speaking through his nose.
All nature tells the beauty of your holiness.
Fishes, trees, ridges, reefs, sheol and the pompous sea.
All adhere to the laws of your soveriegnty.
Say along with me, all breath, my Yahweh's praises.
18: 01: 02: 14: 22The sun can rise again, the moon bitterly sleeps.
Nor friend nor foe tonight, the day merrily calls.
The trees, the grass, the lakes, their lip tenderly keeps
The moonlight kiss, when night in dreams carefully falls.
The stars still dance all dreams with grace in their light twist.
In trees, the wind may swing the true changeable greens
To shake and wake the flower buds' murmuring mist,
When love as sense of self for him turpitude means.Trenches turned to mud pies, by shrapnel splinters sprayed,
saw slivered steel deliver lethal lessons on the sly,
Invader, invaded, found price to pay too high.
Last gasps [g]rasped at straws, each day each day replayed.
Sight shots salvoed over, scared scarred troops who surveyed
behind barbed barricade or fox holes on the fly
dug from former comrades, gangrened flesh, bone dry,
leaden eyes grief laden, hair prematurely greyed.
Senseless slaugher seeding crass orders disobeyed
warfare's despair seeding pandemic which would weigh
casualties exceeding all previous doomsdays,
crimson beads ableeding birthed cenotaph so staid.
Munition powder sky, men cursing shell, grenade,
crossing thunderstorm with Satan's serenade,
Though Tommy would not bow to tyrant's cheap tirade,
pain reigned, bane rain burst from foul, filthy mustard sky -
six hundred thousand souls were frog-marched there to die -
few dodged sniper bullets that often ricocheted.
'Known to God', bagged untagged, few chronicles defrayed,
His_Story selective surrendered with a sigh
shaking, quaking caverns felt doom's gloom whistle by
sad Earth's secret centres soared skywards in cascade.
See meeting-point marquee, stretched canvas marked ‘First Aid',
by stretchers plagued day in day out. Parked there to die,
conscripts fought while Colonels caught some Staff advancement's eye
preparing for fiasco in 1940 played.
Shells shattered ears, hell shuttered eyes, fragile half-life decayed.
Shells scattered tears, knelled stuttered cries, crossfire made lonely maid.
The ‘Last Great War' once over, glad tidings were relayed,
victory crowns in towns cheered Palace balustrade,
most looked on in askance as Lloyd-George was hurrayed
bottled brains in Britain bragged how they'd steady stayed.
But in "land of heroes", though ranks earned accolade,
while most must meals measure, the few in leisure layed.
Some carved while soldiers starved, highlighting masquarade!
Uniforms that won fair maid were worn, drawn fringes frayed,
with chip by chip paint torn from weather-worn façade.
What hair still peeked from cap that peaked showed streaks of care woe greyed.
Instead of fragile faces, poppies bloom on parade.
One hundred years have passed, what lessons has Man learned? ...
No victory can last unless fresh ones are earned.Saving the environment, saving the nature
We can ensure our future life style better
Environment is we grow up having all where
Whose position is nowhere but in this nature;
A plant grows up, produces flowers, fruits, oxygen
Flowers, fruits, oxygen are for beauty, food, life
A being grows up, produces offspring, rear them
Beings need those to live, plants need beings in help;
These both are major agents in environment
For them all other elements are circling
Coming out of womb or shell of egg the urgent
Are environment, nature for first, last living.

Copyright © Muzahidul Reza │19 January,2018Spring we started planting, after tilling the ground
Summer’s blissful weather, nature’s beauties resound
Tiny seedlings hatching, now grow towards the sun
Growing ever skyward, their growing nearly done
Summer’s growing season, its sights and smells and sound
Nature’s blessed harvest, brought in from all around
Autumn’s pleasant bounty, gathered from all the fields
Over until next year, winter’s coldness soon yields.
Nature has done her best, she has given her all
Coming hibernation, at the end of the fall
Wearily now waiting, knowing winter’s approach
Nature starts to wind down, at winters rude encroach
Now the ground is icy, snow drifting in the hedge
Waiting for the springtime, to cut winter’s cruel edge
Shortened daylight hours, winter’s darkest shadows
Slowly daylight lengthens, springtime surely follows.I have forgotten, only John C Maxwell is allowed
to air his ethical, moral opinion; individual feeling,
emotion or thought is outlawed, only consummate
superiority is recognised in this house
I forgot and explained how I felt, you bit off my head
how dare I fly in the face of Maxwell’s wonderful max-
ims, how dare I feel unsettled when reading certain
things, I should react as YOU and -
Your brilliant colleagues do, with total unconcern - how
dare I express a contrary opinion? What a total idiot
I am for telling you what I think, everyone knows my
thoughts and feelings are treason!
So I bite on my tongue and meekly agree with everything
you think, the ethical categorical imperatives are to be
obeyed as Maxwell claims, my idiotic feelings are fit
only for still-born deaths - just be glad
I did not insist on sharing “Hamlet’s Mill” with you, explaining
Samson is an allegory for the process of precession, once I
take on the Bible also you will really blow up, I suppose…Abandoned prams, empty identical wired
with white typed feeding bibs about
and missing their coin deposits, chains dangling, unhired.
Staggering down the street they come, accepted
like cold rejoinders and unspeakable truths
of so much selfish, post-coital regret and haggling.
Unconsciously I quicken stiffen, adrenaline flowing
to satiate biological need, without shame judgement following.
The faster bounce rhythm of the trailer
oddly reassuring should I have car parking failure.
Wish and wash, my spirit, glass door sliding
only 21 days and kids fourteen, distant.
This is home help and annual chance, the limitations of others
not a father’s need for moral guidance.
Foyer clean warm, but what is he doing here:
a psycho babbler, purposeful and at home
standing up straight and proud, even while in another world.
Staff and customer study the invisible, ignore
mongrel dog and guard morose at door.
The mental’s face obscured by lucky charm or paper fetish -
Blake’s Collected Works and Engravings, must be only minutes stolen.
The national treasure’s colour plates unclothed and raised
like a priest praying over those in need of saving.
Wings not beating yet suspended in Heaven, no wires.
Red and yellow friction, two feathered fires
with muscles and faces bursting, above an innocent child.
Untyring angelic forces do battle for sovereigns claim.
The boy slumped but kneeling, pitiable crude suffering
while all about - a pulpy mouth shaped halo kissing him
and wet slobby anchoring, a silver thread suspended
to a mouth and a man
who will never touch someone’s baby
without being apprehended.
Saliva flapping, as the spirit within intrudes
“Is your guardian true, and loving? ”
At the barrier, something stirs unguessed.
Three orange plastic bags clutched tight to chest
like over-burdened maternity breasts, nurturing.
Now forced to pause, a smutty laugh leaks out -
memories of an adult magazine cartoon,
and sperm, blindly thrusting, swimming.
As another sperm wiggles through the tight checkout
the adolescent boy experiences a moment of doubt.
But I enter the cavernous warmth beyond
basket akimbo though bouncing no baby,
and aware of no dirt on the glass of my soul
nor self irony.
Shelves as deep as hills repeating in the distance
searching without risking, sound and worthy, press on.
Suppressed, a hurt deep within, a Freudian fantasim
that reaches out to the fertile shelves, passing
from angry wife and mother, to soft gentle sweater
from repellent abrasive son, to computer Gameboy optimism.
Bustle and tinsel, confident stride, what?
Trapped by a blue-white deformed reflection
in beer freezer metal mirror, highlighting.
Just did not suspect, tainted breath, reviling back
slip splutter, red raw gash, the floor spinning,
head then chest crushed by the expelling aisle.
Vaulted contractions pushing purple extremities, reversion.
A child’s pleading eyes look-up,
happiness seeking, open, feeling
but pointless, premature
without the fresh beginning, of forgiveness, no healing.

Fuzzy surrounding
Curly mind
Seen nothing.I had a gig-horse, and I called him Pleasure
Because on Sundays for a little jaunt
He was so fast and showy, quite a treasure;
Although he sometimes kicked and shied aslant.
I had a chaise, and christened it Enjoyment,

Namely, to go wherever Pleasure led.
I had a wife, her nickname was Delight:
A son called Frolic, who was never still:
Alas! how often dark succeeds to bright!
Delight was thrown, and Frolic had a spill,

towards an island
is chasing the sea and the sea
runs always faster than

it is not that simple
we tend to run as fast as the sea and this

cannot graspIt's an all too common allegory
Pressed from the hands of time
Lent out silent praised theme
Careless whispers never hard to find
With redeeming qualities fading
An elevation of angers hot glow
Bitterness is the totality it's framing
Seperating rightous victims who know
Blazing through their transparent veils
The blame is countered with denial
Running rapidly from the inner problem's core
Slowing down but for a little while
At last catching up to the blameworthy
Who brazenly sit atop  the Moon
Arrogantly still in denial
Their rude awakening is coming soonI had a gig-horse, and I called him Pleasure
Because on Sundays for a little jaunt
He was so fast and showy, quite a treasure;
Although he sometimes kicked and shied aslant.
I had a chaise, and christened it Enjoyment,

Right through towns centre
Nobody suspects anything
So we drink it to excess
It flows from the wide mouth
Of the high lofty hills above
Straight onto our eager tongues
But we don't dare question it
For its source seems pure
Like the artist's untainted painting
It caresses our ego with seductive allure
Like it's some sort of cure
For our perceived inadequacies
And the reality of our insanity
Is that it's all an illusion
Just a simulated humanity
To feed a system of corruption
Perhaps One doomed to destruction
Many are blinded by this water
This strange, delicious water
Because it tastes so sweet
But numbs us from head to feet
This strange marvellous water
Is keeping our minds trapped
From seeing the real truth
...That we are without limits!the eyes are submarines
every moment is a nighttime
beautiful sea creatures of
this mind
forever appeasing
first meetings of lovers

that always brings a new day to me

it is always new and
different
always the first time
virgins in bed
on love's unwearied imaginations
the eyes are submerged
seeing what is not here for the first time
clouds bluer than ever
rotated by a fan
suns hanging on the ceiling behave like the stars in those heavens
those trees shedding off leaves
upon a teasing wind
dogs howl, the rain comes like hair
upon the slender neck of a beloved
doors close, windows open, the house staying put upon love
and the star of the show is silence restrained
too much restraint
joy contained exclusively on those arms tightened
like a jet surging parting the tight legs of a virgin sky.we are all riding in the same boat of
MV Poetry

A wolf pack travels, feral eyes gleaming bright.
Whispers have said, “They are monsters under your bed, ”
But they don’t itch to pick a fight.
They flee from the forest and scatter,
For they’re hounded for their rumored matter.
If they turn and defy, they either live or die,
And fear brings about the latter.
Fear drives people to the brink,
Where they think they know all there is to think.
Once judgment is passed, these things won’t last,
Difference is a poisonous drink.
(Note: Written September 23,2009. How many times do we judge people before we get to know them because of the vicious rumors people spread about them? In this poem, wolves are allegorically representative for people that are different than the homogeneous mixture of people society demands.)A thoughtful Being, long and spare,
Our Race of Mortals call him Care:
(Were Homer living, well he knew
What Name the Gods have call'd him too)
With fine Mechanick Genius wrought,
And lov'd to work, tho' no one bought.
This Being, by a Model bred
In Jove's eternal sable Head,
Contriv'd a Shape impow'rd to breathe,
And be the Worldling here beneath.
The Man rose staring, like a Stake;
Wond'ring to see himself awake!
Then look'd so wise, before he knew
The Bus'ness he was made to do;
That pleas'd to see with what a Grace
He gravely shew'd his forward Face,
Jove talk'd of breeding him on high,
An Under-something of the Sky.
But e'er he gave the mighty Nod,
Which ever binds a Poet's God:
(For which his Curls Ambrosial shake,
And Mother Earth's oblig'd to quake
He saw old Mother Earth arise,
She stood confess'd before his Eyes;
But not with what we read she wore,
A Castle for a Crown before,
Nor with long Streets and longer Roads
Dangling behind her, like Commodes:
As yet with Wreaths alone she drest,
And trail'd a Landskip-painted Vest.
Then thrice she rais'd, (as Ovid said)
And thrice she bow'd, her weighty Head.
Her Honours made, Great Jove, she cry'd,
This Thing was fashion'd from my Side;
His Hands, his Heart, his Head are mine;
Then what hast thou to call him thine?
Nay rather ask, the Monarch said,
What boots his Hand, his Heart, his Head,
Were what I gave remov'd away?
Thy Part's an idle Shape of Clay.
Halves, more than Halves! cry'd honest Care,
Your Pleas wou'd make your Titles fair,
You claim the Body, you the Soul,
But I who join'd them, claim the whole.
Thus with the Gods Debate began,
On such a trivial Cause, as Man.
And can Celestial Tempers rage?
(Quoth Virgil in a later Age.)
As thus they wrangled, Time came by;
(There's none that paint him such as I,
For what the Fabling Antients sung
Makes Saturn old, when Time was young.)
As yet his Winters had not shed
Their silver Honours on his Head;
He just had got his Pinions free
From his old Sire Eternity.
A Serpent girdled round he wore,
The Tail within the Mouth before;
By which our Almanacks are clear
That learned Ægypt meant the Year.
A Staff he carry'd, where on high
A Glass was fix'd to measure by,
As Amber Boxes made a Show
For Heads of Canes an Age ago.
His Vest, for Day, and Night, was py'd;
A bending Sickle arm'd his Side;
And Spring's new Months his Train adorn;
The other Seasons were unborn.
Known by the Gods, as near he draws,
They make him Umpire of the Cause.
O'er a low Trunk his Arm he laid,
(Where since his Hours a Dial made
Then leaning heard the nice Debate,
And thus pronounc'd the Words of Fate.
Since Body from the Parent Earth,
And Soul from Jove receiv'd a Birth,
Return they where they first began;
But since their Union makes the Man,
'Till Jove and Earth shall part these two,
To Care who join'd them, Man is due.
He said, and sprung with swift Career
To trace a Circle for the Year;
Where ever since the Seasons wheel,
And tread on one another's Heel.
'Tis well, said Jove, and for consent
Thund'ring he shook the Firmament.
Our Umpire Time shall have his Way,
With Care I let the Creature stay:
Let Bus'ness vex him, Av'rice blind,
Let Doubt and Knowledge rack his Mind,
Let Error act, Opinion speak,
And Want afflict, and Sickness break,
And Anger burn, Dejection chill,
And Joy distract, and Sorrow kill.
'Till arm'd by Care and taught to Mow,
Time draws the long destructive Blow;
And wasted Man, whose quick decay
Comes hurrying on before his Day,
Shall only find, by this Decree,
The Soul flies sooner back to Me.Biological drive is a hard thing to fight
And if nature has made you a male
Through your will or your crotch you are driven in life
To proverbial chasing of tail
Like a hound on a prowl finest prey you may stalk
Then get trapped being deceived by your senses
For those tails have been known to be wagging their dogs
And dispel with the strongest defenses
Then, sometimes things get tough when you're herding a bunch
You can't tell after who you are chasing
And as dust settles down, with the prize in your teeth
It's your own ass you'll be facing.The fight was over, and the battle won
A soldier, who beneath his chieftain’s eye
Had done a might deed and done it well,
And done it as the world will have it done—
A stab, a curse, some quick play of the butt,
Two skulls cracked crosswise, but the colours saved—
Proud of his wounds, proud of the promised cross,
Turned to his rear-rank man, who on his gun
Leant heavily apart. ‘Ho, friend!’ he called,
‘You did not fight then: were you left behind?
I saw you not.’ The other turned and showed
A gapping, red-lipped wound upon his breast.
‘Ah,’ said he sadly, ‘I was in the smoke!’
Threw up his arms, shivered, and fell and died.I.
A portal as of shadowy adamant
Stands yawning on the highway of the life
Which we all tread, a cavern huge and gaunt;
Around it rages an unceasing strife
Of shadows, like the restless clouds that haunt
The gap of some cleft mountain, lifted high
Into the whirlwinds of the upper sky.
II.
And many pass it by with careless tread,
Not knowing that a shadowy...
Tracks every traveller even to where the dead
Wait peacefully for their companion new;
But others, by more curious humour led,
Pause to examine;—these are very few,
And they learn little there, except to know
That shadows follow them where’er they go.when i was small
i was taught that the meaning
of my life
lies inside the big dome
it is where destiny lies
all explanations possible
are contained in that book
kept inside the golden
casing,
life turns sour
and bitter and
sweetness seems
to be slippery like
an eel,
the dome does not help
and so i turned away
walked outside
and found this new place
outside the dome
trees and grass and
some dragonflies
clouds and cones
fine mornings
calm seas
there are lots of shapes and
colors and
odors
more explanations become possible
they're born like buds turning into
petals
and freedom is like a child
running wild and
talking in chatters
so many songs
and poems
and conversations flow
without fences
i like it here
even without you
i am hurt
but it is different now
i have befriended the pebbles
and the sands

Topic: Birthday of Hazel F. Rodeo (July 26)
Form: Vertical MonocrosticI send you here a sort of allegory,
(For you will understand it) of a soul,
A sinful soul possess'd of many gifts,
A spacious garden full of flowering weeds,
A glorious Devil, large in heart and brain,
That did love Beauty only, (Beauty seen
In all varieties of mould and mind)
And Knowledge for its beauty; or if Good,
Good only for its beauty, seeing not
That beauty, Good, and Knowledge, are three sisters
That doat upon each other, friends to man,
Living together under the same roof,
And never can be sunder'd without tears.
And he that shuts Love out, in turn shall be
Shut out from Love, and on her threshold lie
Howling in outer darkness. Not for this
Was common clay ta'en from the common earth,
Moulded by God, and temper'd with the tears
Of angels to the perfect shape of man.The donkey is kept hidden
"A donkey has been lost"
Is announced,
Reward is also declared,
People are looking for it,
All are failed,
Taking the donkey out of hidden spot
The owner declares
The donkey is found.

When ghostly, solemn light,
Doubting beauty in a breeze
And love outside of time,
Conspiring with the consequences,
Committed doubt to rhyme.
By early morning brilliant light
It was light that was out of time,
And love, hanging on a breeze,
Doing a beauty of a sneeze.Dangers of all kinds
Cancers of all kinds
Go along
The modern long
Ways
With chaos.
Copyright © Muzahidul Reza │20 January,2018"O bees, sweet bees!" I said, "that nearest field
Is shining white with fragrant immortelles.
Fly swiftly there and drain those honey wells."
Then, spicy pines the sunny hive to shield,
I set, and patient for the autumn's yield
Of sweet I waited.
When the village bells
Rang frosty clear, and from their satin cells
The chestnuts leaped, rejoicing, I unsealed
My hive.
Alas! no snowy honey there
Was stored. My wicked bees had borne away
Their queen and left no trace.
That very day,
An idle drone who sauntered through the air
I tracked and followed, and he led me where
My truant bees and stolen honey lay.
Twice faithless bees! They had sought out to eat
Rank, bitter herbs. The honey was not sweet.Oh ponder, friend, the lion
when he roars all the games scatters,
runs away and on and on
are scared that he will rip them to tatters.
How powerful is he
and where he hunts there’s trouble,
for most frailer animals a kind of emergency
as he rushes in for a kill at the double.
Yet as age encumbers him
he is driven from the pack
and looses his self-esteem
while in vain he tries to get his position back
and when old, wounded and in pain
at a time he gets real thin
and even fears the thunder that comes with rain
while it’s a pitiful position that he is in
as through the years he had developed his skills
but a time comes that his kingdom to him is lost
while he not apt to make anymore kills
and finally he has to pay the cost
while every vulture, hyena and jackal
runs circles around him while he snaps in vain
and continually the struggle is for nothing at all
while he doesn’t find anything to gain.PLATO’S CAVE ALLEGORY
(I)
In his seventh book of the famous ‘Republic’,
Plato narrates his cave allegory!
Plight of those prisoners inside the cave,
With their head fixed and limbs all chained!
They could only see the shadows on the front
cave wall,
Of various images of moving life forms!
Illuminated by a burning fire from behind,
A silhouette continuous show  on the walls they
could find!
But when a prisoner breaks through, to face the
sunlight of enlightenment outside,
He momentarily remains blinded by its light!
He rushes back to tell others about ‘true reality’,
But they get angered hearing about his newly
acquired discovery!
Preferring  the ignorance of the cave, taking those
shadows for truth, -
As their real life story!
(II)
Plato’s allegory of the cave is not a spiritual
rendering,
But about the process of acquiring knowledge
and learning!
Those ‘prisoners’ in the cave represents society,
The ‘fire’ burning behind, - their imperfect
knowledge and idiocy!
The dazzling  ‘sun’ outside the cave - as true
enlightenment, - ‘the good’,
For all philosophers seeking ‘true knowledge’ as
they always should!
And those ‘chains’ are the fetters of our mind, -
Our ignorance, prejudices and inhibitions, all
of mental kind!
About which those ‘chained prisoners’ had not the
slightest notion,
And Plato narrates his philosophic views without
emotions!
Plato’s ‘sun’ represents his ‘ideal forms’, his
concept of ‘ultimate good’,
Which centuries later   St Augustine, -
Interpreted as God divine!
Which the medieval world finally understood!
(III)
Look at our society today, being led astray,
By commercialized men and greedy politicians,
With their narrow parochial and vested interests!
Let us also not try to grab all things all at once, -
Which our parents and elders  in the past,
And taken years to build, to make things last!
With plethora of ‘tempting loans’ and materialistic
ways,
Aping those ‘advanced nations’ may only lead to
bad debts one day!
Let us not take those ‘shadowy images’ for truth;
With resilience of mind, our spiritual bindings,
and fortitude!
Remember that all seekers of truth and enlightenment -
since centuries past,
Have been cursed, imprisoned, killed or despised!
Yet seekers of truth shall forever seek to find,
And dare to show the righteous path - to our
misguided mankind!

Introducer And © Muzahidul Reza │ April 9, 2020Spontaneous - intimate obscurity
Suddenly an enlightened certitude trifles
Deep inside, the mind spreads out the landscape
Wide meadows, a quick gush of green
The endless sky shedding blue
And in the soil of time are being sowed chronicles.
Is this the legendary loam, the seeds of the century
That may turn into a tree of elegance?
Incessant downpour in human memory?
Continual motion
River within me
And the allegory of it, without.Those who do not know Salman Rushdie must know it
He is the golden boy
Of dream, allegory and the narrative technique,
Comics is his chief property
With which regales and jokes he,
Caricatures and comments
And criticizes,
An Indian, an Asiatic man
He tells about the adjusting and life-style
Of the immigrants and expatriates
Naturalized and domiciled in foreign,
How far Indian are those who live abroad,
The diaspora dais, dislocation and displacement,
The refugee problem, cultural ethnicity,
The quest for identity,
Settlement and re-settlement.Blizzards, wildfires, Tsunamis and hurricanes caused no trauma
Nor earthquakes & erupted volcanoes did any catostopic drama
Bam, boom, bang, humanbomb blasted in a jungle causing death
With shuddering, trembling & tearing as a misery struck
Horrible horror, terrible terror, mass violence spread, yuck!
Unleashing death, havoc, riots, & unrest in the absolute mayhem
Amphigory, focus-refocus-defocus on the animal farm: an allegory!
Mountains of debris, seas of smoke, dust & rust burst over them
The harmless animals - ducks, chicks, goats're perplexed, o man!
Running, rushing, shouting, yelling, and fainting, they began
Watching at the heap of torn bodies, they forgot to take breath
Wars, massacres, and all forms of evil activities took place
Bullies, rowdies, ruffians, and hooligans ruled without grace
Amphigory, focus-refocus-defocus on the animal farm: an allegory!
Committed crimes, passed the buck on others with an attack
Mistreating, abusing, plotting made them hard nuts to crack
Conflicts on complex matters divided animals into entangled boughs
Corruption, injustice, rottenness and bloodshed are common shows
Virtues buried down in the sea and vices rose up to the sky
Barbarism and terrorism inflicted on them, oh it's not a lie
The poor animals lost peace & morals that ruled for centuries
All are caught in chains of iron rules enforced by all countries.
Amphigory, focus-refocus-defocus on the animal farm; an allegory!
Ferocious animals ran roughshod with bioweapons in Dragon-woods
Chancing to pounce on the lesser animals of neighboring woods
With veto power: Animalia, pigs violated rules in the pigtatorship
nursing venom in their bosom, commited monstrous harms with a whip
They know how to cook goose, take booze, kick those everywhere
And when and how to cast invisible nets to catch fish with a snare.
Amphigory, focus-refocus-defocus on the animal farm: an allegory!
Two small goats were quarreling in another animal farm for toys
Some hyenas of powerful forest rushed to spot rising noise
For their howling at high pitch, bleating became unheard song mime
Bovines, bisons, hippos & rhinos joined the feast with a cruel rhyme
Sheep, cattle, cat, deer & hare with tears ran out of the farm
Mass struggles, class clashes, dreadful ruckus ruled in the same farm
Amphigory, focus-refocus-defocus on the animal farm: an allegory!
With the sudden demise of Napoleon: the pigtator, beasts cheered
Camels, zebras, dogs, monkeys, donkeys & ordinary ones reappeared
In ensuing battle for power, brutal lions emerged victorious
Shared power with wild boars, bears, chetahs & foxes atrocious
By defeating all farms, the bestial rules: animalia, are imposed
Ration's cut, spirit is crushed and to danger, beasts are exposed.

lie the way my tooth is relieved from pain
but he
thought about what i said before
that moment when
the glass was emptied of its black contents
that night inside a cube of ice
when what followed was the transparency
of air
when both sides can be seen at one glance
when goodbyes and hellos
look the same like Siamese twins
when one finally sees through a hole and for a while
glances like a window of rain where you cannot help but just stay as you do not like to dance
and then he
says that
the universe is there and it is
nothing at alli made a cottage
of nipa and bamboo
and rattan
by the side of the
sea
it is not that
luxurious
any common man of this
village may come and
rest
i put the sign that any
tired man may sleep there
any traveler may use it
for free
i was away for three days
when i visited it
the vandals drew a big penis and
a vagina as big as a platter
poured black paint on the floor
and scattered drift wood
in the center of the floor
how unkind are these unknown
vandals?
but we cannot be outdone
we clean it again
repaint it with green and beige
to cover the obscenity
i guess, what devil destroy
God is never tired repairing
because we have promised
to be instruments of good
then we must all comply
now the cottage stands clean again
welcoming still a tired traveler.there is more

the birds are not telling the complete view

and little white houses beside a river
there is more on top of the trees

but there is nothing that can be touched
for the pleasure of the hands
so what is the use?
the feet are ready
and tomorrow is the final leaving
there is no regret

there is more pleasure with the grass

and you open it
and then when you enter the room
another door appears
this is the cycle of doors that keep on appearing and you
keep on opening
but the room still appears from a distance
always distant
from your eager feet to enter
you say to enter the room i must please the door
but the room moves away just the same
and the door tells you
to keep the room
you have to burn it and when the room is burned
the door finally disappears
and then both the door and the room shall tell you
now be happy
for you now have a house of your ownI write for epitaphs on headless graves.
The wind kisses my fingers affectionately.
She wishes that I would shave;
She is as junoesque as the burnished sea,
And as clichéd: I said she should live in
The woods, by the pummel of a dead fallen
Tree, like a coffin still breathing,
And by night a busty epiphany, and opal
By which I stand erect and salute;
I mount by way of root, but waking up
She swims away, back to her bedroom
Far in the city, her eyes going wavering,
Wavering; awakened, she is the allegory
For the sea, doused in salt, yet living;
Her lips the well-meanings of what people
Mean to say; there nests an albatross, yet
To make house calls around our mast doused
In sun. I only wonder if I might stay my hand,
Or damn us all by kissing her.Home is an allegorical word of the world
Do not pollute the home
Where we live
Live our parents
Allegorically our parents are the generations,
Today our home is to the ruins.
Copyright © Muzahidul Reza │13 January,2018No earthquake, no thunder, no volcanic eruption
Or even there was not any of other natural calamities,
A sudden loud sound broke out all through the bush
With whizzing, shuddering, cracking, tearing, echoing,
Fear, horror, dark, terror, misery and ill spirits spread
Committing destruction, death in a horrible situation,
Dust, dirt, smoke coiled over the whole atmosphere
The harmless animals are quite perplexed, helpless
They began crying, shouting, running, rushing, fainting
Seeing reddish spots and innumerable torn bodies.
They blamed one another for committing the crime,
Brawling, harming, plotting hardened in them,
A long conflict complicated and awful tangled
Loosing the worms of crime, injustice and corruption;
The virtues sunk and the vices rose everywhere
Envious state of barbarism, terrorism inflicted on them;
The poor animals lost peace and principles they had
Centuries curses engulfed all what was out of thought.
Ferocious animals are in the neighboring big forest
Who always wait for chances on the helpless ones;
They do not care for hesitating in violating terms
Committing all sorts of hyenas and monstrous harms;
They know how and when to cook poisonous broth
And how to throw an unseen net to catch the rest.
Once some cats were quarrelling nearby the bush
Some wild dogs of the big forest made an instant rush,
For repeated barking mewing was beyond of hearing
Foxes and monkeys also joined within a quick haste
Crows, kites and vultures started crowing for the feast
What more, rats and mice left the bush being frightened
Dreadful tumult, commotion, collision, conflict took place
At the arrival of buffalos, deer, bears, wolfs and hyenas;
But with sudden and unexpected appearance of
Jaguars, lions, tigers and some bears' rejoining to them
Returning from the herd of small and weak beasts
Consisting boars, wolfs, hyenas, wild pigs and dogs,
Though wolfs and hyenas started loudly barking
But came to no use and got chased, retreated soon,
All the surroundings became instant silent and isolated,
All went away murmuring without more looking back.
The victorious were excited having got all easy victory,
But they found troubles to enjoy the whole empire lonely,
So there were roaring, shouting, blustering, threatening
Of occupying empire, power, lordship and over lordship,
Finally, all the bestial rules with ‘Might is right' were
Established in rules and regulations less animal state.
Copyright © Muzahidul Reza | 6 October, 2016'Twas on the famous Empire run,
Whose sun does never set,
Whose grass and water, so they say,
Have never failed them yet --
They carry many million sheep,
Through seasons dry and wet.
They call the homestead Albion House,
And then, along with that,
There's Welshman's Gully, Scotchman's Hill,
And Paddymelon Flat:
And all these places are renowned
For making jumbacks fat.
And the out-paddocks -- holy frost!
There wouldn't be no sense
For me to try and tell you half --
They really are immense;
A man might ride for days and weeks
And never strike a fence.
But still for years they never had
Been known a sheep to lose;
Old Billy Gladstone managed it,
And you can bet your shoes
He'd scores of supers under him,
And droves of jackaroos.
Old Billy had an eagle eye,
And kept his wits about --
If any chaps got trespassing
He quickly cleared 'em out;
And coves that used to "work a cross",
They hated him, no doubt.
But still he managed it in style,
Until the times got dry,
And Billy gave the supers word
To see and mind their eye --
"If any paddocks gets a-fire
I'll know the reason why."
Now on this point old Bill was sure,
Because, for many a year,
Whenever times got dry at all,
As sure as you are here,
The Paddymelon Flat got burnt
Which Bill thought rather queer.
He sent his smartest supers there
To try and keep things right.
No use! The grass was always dry --
They'd go to sleep at night,
And when they woke they'd go and find
The whole concern alight.
One morning it was very hot --
The sun rose in a haze;
Old Bill was cutting down some trees
(One of his little ways);
A black boy came hot-foot to say
The Flat was in a blaze.
Old Bill he swears a fearful oath
And lets the tommy fall --
Says he: "'ll take this business up,
And fix it once for all;
If this goes on the cursed run
Will send us to the wall."
So he withdrew his trespass suits,
He'd one with Dutchy's boss --
In prosecutions criminal
He entered nolle pros.,
But these were neither here nor there --
They always meant a loss.
And off to Paddymelon Flat
He started double quick
Drayloads of men with lots of grog
Lest heat should make them sick,
And all the strangers came around
To see him do the trick.
And there the fire was flaming bright,
For miles and miles it spread,
And many a sheep and horse and cow
Were numbered with the dead --
The super came to meet Old Bill,
And this is what he said:
"No use, to try to beat it out,
'Twill dry you up like toast,
I've done as much as man can do,
Although I never boast;
I think you'd better chuck it up,
And let the jumbucks roast."
Then Bill said just two words: "You're sacked,"
And pitches off his coat,
And wrenches down a blue gum bough
And clears his manly throat,
And into it like threshing wheat
Right sturdily he smote.
And beat the blazing grass until
His shirt was dripping wet;
And all the people watched him there
To see what luck he'd get,
"Gosh! don't he make the cinders fly,"
And, Golly, don't he sweat!"
But though they worked like Trojans all,
The fire still went ahead
So far as you could see around,
The very skies were red,
Sometimes the flames would start afresh,
Just where they thought it dead.
His men, too, quarreled 'mongst themselves
And some coves gave it best
And some said, "Light a fire in front,
And burn from east to west" --
But Bill he still kept sloggin' in,
And never took no rest.
Then through the crowd a cornstalk kid
Come ridin' to the spot
Says he to Bill, "Now take a spell,
You're lookin' very 'ot,
And if you'll only listen, why,
I'll tell you what is what.
"These coves as set your grass on fire,
There ain't no mortal doubt,
I've seen 'em ridin' here and there,
And pokin' round about;
It ain't no use your workin' here,
Until you finds them out.
"See yonder, where you beat the fire --
It's blazin' up again,
And fires are starting right and left
On Tipperary Plain,
Beating them out is useless quite,
Unless Heaven sends the rain.
Then Bill, he turns upon the boy,
"Oh, hold your tongue, you pup!"
But a cinder blew across the creek
While Bill stopped for a sup,
And fired the Albion paddocks, too --
It was a bitter cup;
Old Bill's heart was broke at last,
He had to chuck it up.
Moral
The run is England's Empire great,
The fire is the distress
That burns the stock they represent --
Prosperity you'll guess.
And the blue gum bough is the Home Rule Bill
That's making such a mess.
And Ireland green, of course I mean
By Paddymelon Flat;
All men can see the fire, of course,
Spreads on at such a bat,
But who are setting it alight,
I cannot tell you that.
But this I think all men will see,
And hold it very true --
"Don't quarrel with effects until
The cause is brought to view."
What is the cause? That cornstalk boy --
He seemed to think he knew.I am wondering what became of all those tall abstractions
that used to pose, robed and statuesque, in paintings
and parade about on the pages of the Renaissance
displaying their capital letters like license plates.
Truth cantering on a powerful horse,
Chastity, eyes downcast, fluttering with veils.
Each one was marble come to life, a thought in a coat,
Courtesy bowing with one hand always extended,
Villainy sharpening an instrument behind a wall,
Reason with her crown and Constancy alert behind a helm.
They are all retired now, consigned to a Florida for tropes.
Justice is there standing by an open refrigerator.
Valor lies in bed listening to the rain.
Even Death has nothing to do but mend his cloak and hood,
and all their props are locked away in a warehouse,
hourglasses, globes, blindfolds and shackles.
Even if you called them back, there are no places left
for them to go, no Garden of Mirth or Bower of Bliss.
The Valley of Forgiveness is lined with condominiums
and chain saws are howling in the Forest of Despair.
Here on the table near the window is a vase of peonies
and next to it black binoculars and a money clip,
exactly the kind of thing we now prefer,
objects that sit quietly on a line in lower case,
themselves and nothing more, a wheelbarrow,
an empty mailbox, a razor blade resting in a glass ashtray.
As for the others, the great ideas on horseback
and the long-haired virtues in embroidered gowns,
it looks as though they have traveled down
that road you see on the final page of storybooks,
the one that winds up a green hillside and disappears
into an unseen valley where everyone must be fast asleep.On all the deer

He too has flitted from his secret nest,
Hope's last and dearest child without a name!--
Has flitted from me, like the warmthless flame,
That makes false promise of a place of rest
To the tired Pilgrim's still believing mind;--
Or like some Elfin Knight in kingly court,
Who having won all guerdons in his sport,
Glides out of view, and whither none can find!
II.
Yes! he hath flitted from me--with what aim,
Or why, I know not! 'Twas a home of bliss,
And he was innocent, as the pretty shame
Of babe, that tempts and shuns the menaced kiss,
From its twy-cluster'd hiding place of snow!
Pure as the babe, I ween, and all aglow
As the dear hopes, that swell the mother's breast--
Her eyes down gazing o'er her clasped charge;--
Yet gay as that twice happy father's kiss,
That well might glance aside, yet never miss,
Where the sweet mark emboss'd so sweet a targe--
Twice wretched he who hath been doubly blest!
III.
Like a loose blossom on a gusty night
He flitted from me--and has left behind
(As if to them his faith he ne'er did plight)
Of either sex and answerable mind
Two playmates, twin-births of his foster-dame:--
The one a steady lad (Esteem he hight)
And Kindness is the gentler sister's name.
Dim likeness now, though fair she be and good,
Of that bright boy who hath us all forsook;--
But in his full-eyed aspect when she stood,
And while her face reflected every look,
And in reflection kindled--she became
So like him, that almost she seem'd the same!
IV.
Ah! he is gone, and yet will not depart!--
Is with me still, yet I from him exiled!
For still there lives within my secret heart
The magic image of the magic Child,
Which there he made up-grow by his strong art,
As in that crystal orb--wise Merlin's feat,--
The wondrous 'World of Glass,' wherein inisled
All long'd for things their beings did repeat;--
And there he left it, like a Sylph beguiled,
To live and yearn and languish incomplete!
V.
Can wit of man a heavier grief reveal?
Can sharper pang from hate or scorn arise?--
Yes! one more sharp there is that deeper lies,
Which fond Esteem but mocks when he would heal.
Yet neither scorn nor hate did it devise,
But sad compassion and atoning zeal!
One pang more blighting-keen than hope betray'd!
And this it is my woeful hap to feel,
When, at her Brother's hest, the twin-born Maid
With face averted and unsteady eyes,
Her truant playmate's faded robe puts on;
And inly shrinking from her own disguise
Enacts the faery Boy that's lost and gone.
O worse than all! O pang all pangs above
Is Kindness counterfeiting absent Love.The State (Allegory)

And among the winds and beams

Night is coming!SECOND SPIRIT
The deathless stars are bright above;
If I would cross the shade of night,
Within my heart is the lamp of love,
And that is day!
And the moon will smile with gentle light
On my golden plumes where'er they move;
The meteors will linger round my flight,
And make night day.FIRST SPIRIT
But if the whirlwinds of darkness waken
Hail, and lightning, and stormy rain;
See, the bounds of the air are shaken--
Night is coming!
The red swift clouds of the hurricane
Yon declining sun have overtaken,
The clash of the hail sweeps over the plain--
Night is coming!SECOND SPIRIT
I see the light, and I hear the sound;
I'll sail on the flood of the tempest dark,
With the calm within and the light around
Which makes night day:
And thou, when the gloom is deep and stark,
Look from thy dull earth, slumber-bound,
My moon-like flight thou then mayst mark
On high, far away.----
Some say there is a precipice
Where one vast pine is frozen to ruin
O'er piles of snow and chasms of ice
Mid Alpine mountains;
And that the languid storm pursuing
That winged shape, for ever flies
Round those hoar branches, aye renewing
Its aëry fountains.
Some say when nights are dry and dear,
And the death-dews sleep on the morass,
Sweet whispers are heard by the traveller,
Which make night day:
And a silver shape like his early love doth pass
Upborne by her wild and glittering hair,
And when he awakes on the fragrant grass,
He finds night day.The Ugly Dogs And Drunkard Guards (Allegory And Satire)

No sooner had the sacks of rice released from godown
Than the butcher chased dogs snatched,
Biting the sacks they began to run here and there
But they could not fully tear,
Soon the ugly dogs were kicked and beaten
And the most of the sacks were rescued
Through a long harassment and bearing others' pain
By the dull headed, drunkard guards.The white pigeons are flying in the blue sky

who don’t speak to strangers.
Alone
I sit, looking at the clock, seeing
friends
consider me as nothing.
Sit in a chair
alone
People I thought were
friends
sit together, but away from me.Tell me why it has to be this way
why I must face this life alone
Sanctuaries I thought were strong
now lay crumbled around my kneeling form
tears that fall down my placid skin
hidden by the rain that falls from a broken sky
Behind blinded eyes I hear the echoes
of those I loved in days now past
taunting me and haunting me in the frozen air
Surrounding and slowly taking away a light forever dimmed
As lightning flashes I see the woman I was float away
leaving me withered and nothing more than an empty shell
as the ones I held dear one by one turn away from me
Tell me why it has to be this way
why I must face this life alone
condemed to walking in the blackness
until it finally consumes me and I fade to nothing.A debtor to mercy alone, of covenant mercy I sing;
Nor fear, with Thy righteousness on, my person and off’ring to bring.
The terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing to do;
My Savior’s obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view.
The work which His goodness began, the arm of His strength will complete;
His promise is Yea and Amen, and never was forfeited yet.
Things future, nor things that are now, nor all things below or above,
Can make Him His purpose forgo, or sever my soul from His love.
My name from the palms of His hands eternity will not erase;
Impressed on His heart it remains, in marks of indelible grace.
Yes, I to the end shall endure, as sure as the earnest is giv’n;
More happy, but not more secure, the glorified spirits in heav’n.A heart breaks easier alone
When no one sees you crying
When no one notices at all
That inside you are dying
A heart breaks easier alone
When they all think you're crazy
That when you crawl back in your bed
The whole world thinks you're lazy
A heart breaks easier alone
And there's no way to mend it
To stop the heart from breaking more
You simply have to end it
A heart breaks easier alone
Without a love to heal it
And finally the breaking's done
When you no longer feel itAs she sits alone on the hillside watching the sunrise
Silence is golden, movement is absent
Upon the grassy fields she sees shadowing darkness
The freshness in the air surrounds her intensely
Silence is golden,  movement is absent
Dawn breaks, the skies come alive
The freshness in the air surrounds her intensely
Birds flutter freely tweetering 'good morning'
Dawn breaks, the skies come alive
Upon the grassy fields she sees shadowing darkness
Birds flutter freely tweetering 'good morning'
As she sits alone on the hillside watching the sunriseA year has been passed since I left home
Again my life become lonely in the military barracks
My life without you, left me with only tears
I know that you never want to see me in tears
But it's been so hard to be here without you
When I am away from you, there is part of me dying
and I don't know where to hide my tears
Although, the distance has kept us away
but your memories keep on speaks to me
Always, It tells me that our love is to be loved
No one makes me feel the way you do
No one loves me so much the way you love me
When I am stay at the door of your heart
then I feel your inside flames that's burns my soul
Oh my love, let God speed my love
and bring me again into your arms soon.I.
Ah! wherefore by the Church-yard side,
Poor little LORN ONE, dost thou stray?
Thy wavy locks but thinly hide
The tears that dim thy blue-eye's ray;
And wherefore dost thou sigh, and moan,
And weep, that thou art left alone?
II.
Thou art not left alone, poor boy,
The Trav'ller stops to hear thy tale;
No heart, so hard, would thee annoy!
For tho' thy mother's cheek is pale
And withers under yon grave stone,
Thou art not, Urchin, left alone.
III.
I know thee well ! thy yellow hair
In silky waves I oft have seen;
Thy dimpled face, so fresh and fair,
Thy roguish smile, thy playful mien
Were all to me, poor Orphan, known,
Ere Fate had left thee--all alone!
IV.
Thy russet coat is scant, and torn,
Thy cheek is now grown deathly pale!
Thy eyes are dim, thy looks forlorn,
And bare thy bosom meets the gale;
And oft I hear thee deeply groan,
That thou, poor boy, art left alone.
V.
Thy naked feet are wounded sore
With thorns, that cross thy daily road;
The winter winds around thee roar,
The church-yard is thy bleak abode;
Thy pillow now, a cold grave stone--
And there thou lov'st to grieve--alone!
VI.
The rain has drench'd thee, all night long;
The nipping frost thy bosom froze;
And still, the yewtree-shades among,
I heard thee sigh thy artless woes;
I heard thee, till the day-star shone
In darkness weep--and weep alone!
VII.
Oft have I seen thee, little boy,
Upon thy lovely mother's knee;
For when she liv'd--thou wert her joy,
Though now a mourner thou must be!
For she lies low, where yon grave-stone
Proclaims, that thou art left alone.
VIII.
Weep, weep no more; on yonder hill
The village bells are ringing, gay;
The merry reed, and brawling rill
Call thee to rustic sports away.
Then wherefore weep, and sigh, and moan,
A truant from the throng--alone?
IX.
"I cannot the green hill ascend,
"I cannot pace the upland mead;
"I cannot in the vale attend,
"To hear the merry-sounding reed:
"For all is still, beneath yon stone,
"Where my poor mother's left alone!
X.
"I cannot gather gaudy flowers
"To dress the scene of revels loud--
"I cannot pass the ev'ning hours
"Among the noisy village croud--
"For, all in darkness, and alone
"My mother sleeps, beneath yon stone.
XI.
"See how the stars begin to gleam
"The sheep-dog barks, 'tis time to go;--
"The night-fly hums, the moonlight beam
"Peeps through the yew-tree's shadowy row--
"It falls upon the white grave-stone,
"Where my dear mother sleeps alone.--
XII.
"O stay me not, for I must go
"The upland path in haste to tread;
"For there the pale primroses grow
"They grow to dress my mother's bed.--
"They must, ere peep of day, be strown,
"Where she lies mould'ring all alone.
XIII.
"My father o'er the stormy sea
"To distant lands was borne away,
"And still my mother stay'd with me
"And wept by night and toil'd by day.
"And shall I ever quit the stone
"Where she is, left, to sleep alone.
XIV.
"My father died; and still I found
"My mother fond and kind to me;
"I felt her breast with rapture bound
"When first I prattled on her knee--
"And then she blest my infant tone
"And little thought of yon grave-stone.
XV.
"No more her gentle voice I hear,
"No more her smile of fondness see;
"Then wonder not I shed the tear
"She would have DIED, to follow me!
"And yet she sleeps beneath yon stone
"And I STILL LIVE--to weep alone.
XVI.
"The playful kid, she lov'd so well
"From yon high clift was seen to fall;
"I heard, afar, his tink'ling bell--
"Which seem'd in vain for aid to call--
"I heard the harmless suff'rer moan,
"And grieved that he was left alone.
XVII.
"Our faithful dog grew mad, and died,
"The lightning smote our cottage low--
"We had no resting-place beside
"And knew not whither we should go,--
"For we were poor,--and hearts of stone
"Will never throb at mis'ry's groan.
XVIII.
"My mother still surviv'd for me,
"She led me to the mountain's brow,
"She watch'd me, while at yonder tree
"I sat, and wove the ozier bough;
"And oft she cried, "fear not, MINE OWN!
"Thou shalt not, BOY, be left ALONE."
XXI.
"The blast blew strong, the torrent rose
"And bore our shatter'd cot away;
"And, where the clear brook swiftly flows--
"Upon the turf at dawn of day,
"When bright the sun's full lustre shone,
"I wander'd, FRIENDLESS--and ALONE!"
XX.
Thou art not, boy, for I have seen
Thy tiny footsteps print the dew,
And while the morning sky serene
Spread o'er the hill a yellow hue,
I heard thy sad and plaintive moan,
Beside the cold sepulchral stone.
XXI.
And when the summer noontide hours
With scorching rays the landscape spread,
I mark'd thee, weaving fragrant flow'rs
To deck thy mother's silent bed!
Nor, at the church-yard's simple stone,
Wert, thou, poor Urchin, left alone.
XXII.
I follow'd thee, along the dale
And up the woodland's shad'wy way:
I heard thee tell thy mournful tale
As slowly sunk the star of day:
Nor, when its twinkling light had flown,
Wert thou a wand'rer, all alone.
XXIII.
"O! yes, I was! and still shall be
"A wand'rer, mourning and forlorn;
"For what is all the world to me--
"What are the dews and buds of morn?
"Since she, who left me sad, alone
"In darkness sleeps, beneath yon stone!
XXIV.
"No brother's tear shall fall for me,
"For I no brother ever knew;
"No friend shall weep my destiny
"For friends are scarce, and tears are few;
"None do I see, save on this stone
"Where I will stay, and weep alone!
XXV.
"My Father never will return,
"He rests beneath the sea-green wave;
"I have no kindred left, to mourn
"When I am hid in yonder grave!
"Not one ! to dress with flow'rs the stone;--
"Then--surely , I AM LEFT ALONE!"Sitting all alone in a boxed room
looking at the walls locking in on me
looking like they are about to fall in and 'BOOM'
wondering what my life is going to be.
thinking to myself should i take that step out of the door
or maybe just sit here and cry for myself
'but what is there to life for' i should just lay here on this cold floor
i can't even call for help because i am all by myslef.: (SO many crosses,
so little hope, so many
puppets, praying for
some thing they dont
even believe in.where
is your devels, where are
your saints, where is your
GOD, when you fill your
body with drink, so many
crosses, so little faith,
so many puppets, waiting
for....what?When I'm talking to you,
I am never alone.
You are there. Your voice,
My sanity.
Then, you are gone,
Leaving me in a terrifying silent darkness.
When you are gone, no matter who may be around me,
I am alone again.
-He was writing his sermon.
He'd locked his room.
He wanted none to break his thoughts.
No one would ever disturb him.
He was alone, alone, alone.
He was fixing his false teeth,
behind closed doors.
He wanted none to peep in on his secret.
No one would want to know if he had teeth.
He was alone, alone, alone.
He was counting his coins,
in the darkness of his shabby hut.
He wanted none to know his wealth.
No one wanted his meager sum.
He was alone, alone, alone.
You and I are all like them,
locked behind our own doors,
not wanting to be pried into.
Not knowing how isolated we are.
We are just alone, alone, alone.Alone in the dark room
No one cares about me
so Lonely that i don`t find one to say ' hey '
No one can understand my feelings, my pain
No one can satisfy my soul
My soul covered with Darkness
empty with the precious values
full of the nothingness of the world
the estrangement forms a pic, a wired pic
No one can see, except me
so frightened this world
trying to escape from the pic
no hope to make it a way
following me as myself
Have one aim is to kill
decide to stop running
to find away to hide
New feeling i got to release
For the first time iam ready for the fight
But, it`s not important who will win
What really matters that ' i tried to prove myself 'Im nothing without
you Im dead inside
I cant move on
I know cuz I've tried
You threw me out the door
Im a lost soul forever moor
These are my tears
My tears of pain
with out you my
world is constant rain
Love is a lie theres nosuch thing
all it is is a firey black ring
You have lied to me but worse
you've played with my heart
You tried explain just please
dont even start
You said you loved me
you said you cared
how could you dismiss
everything we shared
So the damage is done
and all you did was run
I will never love anyone but you
That day rain came and the wind just blew
When I saw you my heart was sold
but now I sit all alone and cold.Amongst the flowers I
am alone with my pot of wine
drinking by myself; then lifting
my cup I asked the moon
to drink with me, its reflection
and mine in the wine cup, just
the three of us; then I sigh
for the moon cannot drink,
and my shadow goes emptily along
with me never saying a word;
with no other friends here, I can
but use these two for company;
in the time of happiness, I
too must be happy with all
around me; I sit and sing
and it is as if the moon
accompanies me; then if I
dance, it is my shadow that
dances along with me; while
still not drunk, I am glad
to make the moon and my shadow
into friends, but then when
I have drunk too much, we
all part; yet these are
friends I can always count on
these who have no emotion
whatsoever; I hope that one day
we three will meet again,
deep in the Milky Way.A friend I possess, whose whispers just said,
"God's peace!" to my night-watching mind.
When daylight is gone and darkness brings dread,
He ever the way can find.
He utters no word to smite and to score;
He, too, has known sin and its grief.
He heals with his look the place that is sore,
And stays till I have relief.
He takes for his own the deed that is such
That sorrows of heart increase.
He cleanses the wound with so gentle a touch,
The pain must give way to peace.
He followed each hope the heights that would scale
Reproached not a hapless descent.
He stands here just now, so mild, but so pale; --
In time he shall know what it meant.298

Alone iam dying alone in alone island
Alone iam alone in alone islandOnce there stood a castle,
With towers so tall of stone,
So strong and white
Glowing like ivory bone
In the castle lived a princess
So lovely and so kind
Many times she dreamt of him
The prince she'd someday find
When the time finally came
And they stood side by side
Her heart sang with beautiful feelings
That time could not abide
They spent all their time together
Until summer came to an end
He then kissed her and departed
Disappearing into the wind
At nights she stood and waited
But never once did he return
Her head was bent with sorrow
Her eyes swollen from tears
For she knew he would not return tomorrow
And she would be alone for all her years
She thought she had given him her heart
For what they shared was special and true
But when sorrow came he left her
For he knew nothing else to do
The princess had nothing left to hang onto
No tiny thread of hope
She had no one left to turn to
And no one to help her cope
She went to the places they had been
Yet it was not the same without him
The flowers no longer cheered her
And the bright sun had become dim
He hadn't meant to hurt her
But the princess was lost in her own woe
All she felt was betrayal
In knowing he had to go
But with time she came to realize
He did what he had to do
Although her pain was horrible
He felt that pain, too.
The two had shared so much
They had given all they had
And knowing it was truly over
Oh, how it made the princess sad
She hadn't thought she would truly lose him
No matter how bad it may have been
They were more than in love
He had been her one and only friend
One night she found a message
Scrawled on the castle wall.
It said only, 'I love you, '
And the princess's tears began to fall.
She knew she'd always miss him;
He'd remain forever in her heart,
And even if they weren't together,
They'd never truly be apart....I walked alone
In Ann Arbor last night,
But you were
With me again on South Main
Among the college kids,
The restaurants and book stores,
Everyone moving around,
The folk music
Coming from the Ark;
Sweet Lady, you’ve won my heart,
Even though we continue to linger
So painfully apart.Alone in crowds to wander on,
And feel that all the charm is gone
Which voices dear and eyes beloved
Shed round us once, where'er we roved --
This, this the doom must be
Of all who've loved, and loved to see
The few bright things they thought would stay
For ever near them, die away.
Though fairer forms around us throng,
Their smiles to others all belong,
And want that charm which dwells alone
Round those the fond heart calls its own,
Where, where the sunny brow?
The long-known voice -- where are they now?
Thus ask I still, nor ask in vain,
The silence answers all too plain.
Oh, what is Fancy's magic worth,
If all her art cannot call forth
One bliss like those we felt of old
From lips now mute, and eyes now cold?
No, no -- her spell in vain --
As soon could she bring back again
Those eyes themselves from out the grave,
As wake again one bliss they gave.the clouds cover my heart,
I am alone in hospital,
nurses coming and out,
I feel I am alone.
Even nurses here and there,
I am out of the world,
sad and pain hit my face,
how bad to be alone.
The doctor whispered to me,
be brave, don, t afraid,
tomorrow will be better,
be strong as a stone.
My mind had been ruined,
i can, t thinking at all,
the sky seems hazy,
how sad to be alone.
........
Seconds seem ages;
the day a thousand year,
the fear inside my body,
told me, you are alone.
Suddenly I saw a shade,
could that be my wife?
Could sons come to see,
how sad I am alone.
The shade became too close,
O, God they are my sons,
my love is coming with them,
how bad I was alone.
By love they covered my sky,
by love returned my soul,
their love grant me the strength,
in front of being alone.
Tomorrow will repair my heart,
tomorrow is a biggest day,
even if I died that day.
By love I am not alone.alone in my darknees
i was alone...
alone i live in my darkness..
no one share me..
no one considerated my feelings..
i was a human without sense...
without loving....
and i was without heart....

and after its make my heart a white..
no, no, don`t let my heart become agian blackest..
and don`t let me be agian alone...
plz don`t do.....I was walking alone in my forest one day,
Sleeping awake I went on my way,
And as I lookeed up the sun caught my face,
And my tears fell down in ribbons of lace.
The trees were entwined in the sky locked above,
In an extraordinary symbol of beautiful love,
And I walked all alone in my little wood,
And everything seemed just like it should,
Shafts of light stabbed all around,
Extending their arms straight to the ground,
Serene and peaceful the air hung in cloud,
Enveloping me in a wonderfull shrowd.
And all of this lay before me at hand,
Unfortunately though, no matter how grand
It all was a dream, it all was a fake,
Something I could never see awake.
I was walking alone in my forest one day,
Sleeping awake I went on my way,
And as I lookeed up the sun caught my face,
And my tears fell down in ribbons of lace.I know a seraph who has golden eyes,
And hair of gold, and body like the snow.
Here in the wind I dream her unbound hair
Is blowing round me, that desire's sweet glow
Has touched her pale keen face, and willful mien.
And though she steps as one in manner born
To tread the forests of fair Paradise,
Dark memory's wood she chooses to adorn.
Here with bowed head, bashful with half-desire
She glides into my yesterday's deep dream,
All glowing by the misty ferny cliff
Beside the far forbidden thundering stream.
Within my dream I shake with the old flood.
I fear its going, ere the spring days go.
Yet pray the glory may have deathless years,
And kiss her hair, and sweet throat like the snow.Alone in the woods I felt
The bitter hostility of the sky and the trees
Nature has taught her creatures to hate
Man that fusses and fumes
Unquiet man
As the sap rises in the trees
As the sap paints the trees a violent green
So rises the wrath of Nature's creatures
At man
So paints the face of Nature a violent green.
Nature is sick at man
Sick at his fuss and fume
Sick at his agonies
Sick at his gaudy mind
That drives his body
Ever more quickly
More and more
In the wrong direction.perhaps im done.

Conversations on which we could agree.
There has never been enough trust to discuss
Issues in which we'd disagree.
Our hearts don't have the magic connection
That allow our brains to share the same waves.
Cupid has not struck us with his arrows,
To each other's soul we are not slaves.
We occupy the same space, living in orbit.
Our eyes meet across silence the size of an ocean,
And while our intentions are in the right place,
Fear is the source of our eternal devotion.
You don't know how much I need you.
I don't know why I expect you to read my mind.

The mystery is why romance is so hard to find.'So round, so firm
So fully packed,
So free and easy.

Can of Hormel Vienna Sausages.All the birds have flown up and gone;
A lonely cloud floats leisurely by.
We never tire of looking at each other -
Only the mountain and I.The sorrow of riverside blossoms inexplicable,
And nowhere to complain -- I've gone half crazy.
I look up our southern neighbor. But my friend in wine
Gone ten days drinking. I find only an empty bed.
A thick frenzy of blossoms shrouding the riverside,
I stroll, listing dangerously, in full fear of spring.
Poems, wine -- even this profusely driven, I endure.
Arrangements for this old, white-haired man can wait.
A deep river, two or three houses in bamboo quiet,
And such goings on: red blossoms glaring with white!
Among spring's vociferous glories, I too have my place:
With a lovely wine, bidding life's affairs bon voyage.
Looking east to Shao, its smoke filled with blossoms,
I admire that stately Po-hua wineshop even more.
To empty golden wine cups, calling such beautiful
Dancing girls to embroidered mats -- who could bear it?
East of the river, before Abbot Huang's grave,
Spring is a frail splendor among gentle breezes.
In this crush of peach blossoms opening ownerless,
Shall I treasure light reds, or treasure them dark?
At Madame Huang's house, blossoms fill the paths:
Thousands, tens of thousands haul the branches down.
And butterflies linger playfully -- an unbroken
Dance floating to songs orioles sing at their ease.
I don't so love blossoms I want to die. I'm afraid,
Once they are gone, of old age still more impetuous.
And they scatter gladly, by the branchful. Let's talk
Things over, little buds ---open delicately, sparingly.Alone...at birth
Alone...at death
Not alone...in the afterlifeoh, , sadness...

and your memories waves flooded me..

and in which wilderness, can i found you..? ? ?
i am a star without sense...
i am a candy without taste..
and here alone in that beach....Alone i lay on a wooden raft
Alone i stay in the dark
Alone i pray to survive
Alone i may not survive
Alone i look out the sea
Alone i wake up on the sea
Alone i seek out for help
Alone i may not survive
Alone i eat my dry food
Alone i drink the salty water
Alone i sit in the cold
Alone i may not survive
Alone, yes, alone i stare at the storm
Alone, yes, alone i live on the sea
Alone, yes, alone i wait for the rescue boat
Alone, yes, alone i may not survive
Alone, yes, alone i pray to be safe
Alone, yes, alone i call out for help
Alone, yes, alone i get on the boat
Alone, yes, alone i was rescued
Alone, yes, alone i lived on sea for months
Alone, yes, alone i walk ashore unaided
Alone, yes, alone i continue to hold the
Guinness World Record for survival at seaIn contact, lo! the flint and steel,
By sharp and flame, the thought reveal
That he the metal, she the stone,
Had cherished secretly alone.Alone I drift away,
Alone I walk a thousand miles,
Alone I fall asleep,
Alone I stare at the sky,
Alone I sit under a tree,
Alone I cry.
Alone I dream of you,
Alone I hope and pray,
to God who is oh so merciful and powerful
to let me find my way.
Alone I drift away,
Alone I live today,
and alone I'll die someday.My friends.
Where are you?
I want you.
I need you.
I want to say
Something.
When you ask what’s wrong, I say
Nothing.
When you turn away, I whisper
Everything.Over the fence, the dead settle in
for a journey. Nine o'clock.
You are alone for the first time
today. Boys asleep. Husband out.
A beer bottle sweats in your hand,
and sea lavender clogs the air
with perfume. Think of yourself.
Your arms rest with nothing to do
after weeks spent attending to others.
Your thoughts turn to whether
butter will last the week, how much
longer the car can run on its partial tank of gas.Surrounded by people
But so all alone
Feeling so lonely
No place to call home
Does he love me
When he is so cold
Do I have purpose
Shall I let this go on
I have no purpose
I am totally numb
To think he loved me
I was totally dumb
Love doesn't exist
In this house anyway
Home is where the heart is
And I have none!From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were; I have not seen
As others saw; I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I loved, I loved alone.
Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
Of a most stormy life- was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold,
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by,
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view.The noon's greygolden meshes make
All night a veil,
The shorelamps in the sleeping lake
Laburnum tendrils trail.
The sly reeds whisper to the night
A name-- her name-
And all my soul is a delight,
A swoon of shame.The day Caleb died
I was all alone
Lying in a hospital bed
So white and cold
Bleeding
Though I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
Praying for someone to come
Watching the door
Hoping and praying
But I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
I almost died too
Yet no one was around
And there was no one to hold
For I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
I prayed for God to take me, too
But I didn't go
I prayed for someone to hold
But I was all aloneDay by day, I wake alone, in a cold and empty bed,
Day by day, thoughts of you, keep running through my head.
I wake and wish this day would be the one I see your smile
I sit and wait to see your face, I'm living in denial.
Because I know that there's no way that I'll see you today,
And as the sun begins to set, my hopes will slip away.
As darkness covers this cruel world, my heart grows darker too,
And I will whisper to the night how much I long for you.
The stars begin to twinkle, lighting up the sky above,
But the only light I long to see is the light of your love.
I pray tomorrow is that day that I'm holding you tight,
As in my cold and empty bed, I stare alone into the night.Lying, thinking
Last night
How to find my soul a home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I don't believe I'm wrong
That nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
There are some millionaires
With money they can't use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
They've got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone.
But nobody
No, nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Now if you listen closely
I'll tell you what I know
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow
The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan,
'Cause nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.What is the difference in being all alone over here by my self
Or all alone over there with people who don’t care
And could careless if I was there with them
Watching
Waiting
Not being spoken too
Waiting for the right moment to speak
Sneak a peak of what its like on the inside
I am all alone where ever I go
Whether I am alone in a room full of people
Or an empty field all by my self
I feel the feeling of wanting
Need and striving to be with you
With someone
Anyone at all
But I can’t
I am all ways alone
In the cold
On my own
Whether it be in a crowed room
Or in a field all of my own
I am all alone
What is the true difference between being alone on my own
Or with people who don’t care
It doesn’t matter anyways
Why make a false invite and
Try to be polite
When you just turn me away
I am alone whether it be in a room crowded with people
Or alone in an empty field
With no one around to hear me scream and bleed and cry
What really is the difference between
Being alone with a crowd of people who don’t care
And being all alone over there.
Alone on a bench to cryAll alone, no one here
Not even a soul is 5ft near
A 4 player game being played by one
And it is actually kinda fun
'I pick up my life and take it on a one way ticket
Wherever I go it's my path so I'll pick it'
Sitting here alone, by the windowsill
But the air is bored, it must be filled
One comes in, then comes three
They have all come to join me
But I was happy didn't own a bored bone
I was happy when I was aloneI am alone, in spite of love,
In spite of all I take and give—
In spite of all your tenderness,
Sometimes I am not glad to live.
I am alone, as though I stood
On the highest peak of the tired gray world,
About me only swirling snow,
Above me, endless space unfurled;
With earth hidden and heaven hidden,
And only my own spirit's pride
To keep me from the peace of those
Who are not lonely, having died.I’ve listened: and all the sounds I heard
Were music,—wind, and stream, and bird.
With youth who sang from hill to hill
I’ve listened: my heart is hungry still.
I’ve looked: the morning world was green;
Bright roofs and towers of town I’ve seen;
And stars, wheeling through wingless night.
I’ve looked: and my soul yet longs for light.
I’ve thought: but in my sense survives
Only the impulse of those lives
That were my making. Hear me say
‘I’ve thought!’—and darkness hides my day.The abode of the nightingale is bare,
Flowered frost congeals in the gelid air,
The fox howls from his frozen lair:
Alas, my loved one is gone,
I am alone:
It is winter.
Once the pink cast a winy smell,
The wild bee hung in the hyacinth bell,
Light in effulgence of beauty fell:
I am alone:
It is winter.
My candle a silent fire doth shed,
Starry Orion hunts o'erhead;
Come moth, come shadow, the world is dead:
Alas, my loved one is gone,
I am alone;
It is winter.I, one who never speaks,
Listened days in summer trees,
Each day a rustling leaf.
Then, in time, my unbelief
Grew like my running -
My own eyes did not exist,
When I struck I never missed.
Noon, felt and far away -
My brain is a thousand bees.Alone in the world of writs
I stand alone
To mockery because my shoes are worn,
My suit torn.
Alone,
Because I refused to invest my time
In vanity of men’s wealth
The relentless treadmill of materialism.
The infinity of human thoughts are vital to me
While friends and colleagues
Constant in the mad rush for avarice
Alone,
When I speak against societal ills
Paid writers mock at me
And call me ‘fool’!
My mind, preaching constant messages of irrelevances
Because I will die a writer.
No money,
No friends,
No foe.
Alone,
When intelligent comrades backslide
into a reverse and praising of societal tyranny.
Alone,
When vanity of fame and temporal gain
Reduce men of honour
To a  loose dissolved state of lies.
Alone,
When the courage for truth
Falls to a beggarly withdrawal for fear
Alone,
When mass comrades reduce intelligence
To cheap Trade by Bata.
Alone,
When moneybags employ friends
In the service of sly.
Alone,
When kings and kingdom
Turn greater minds to lesser scribe.
Alone,
When hunger, pain, loneliness
Stare in the face
For uncommon stance.
Alone,
Let lies increase
Vanity multiply
Comrades compromise
Hunger kill
Clothes burnt
Impoverished me be
With no friends
No follower
And in the grave
Just like I came,
Alone, Alone.alone
yes I am
alone i will be
give it time you will see
i drink alone
i sleep alone
i walk alone too
when you give up on me
i know what to do
i slice and I dice
i cut me to shreds
alone i tell i am
alone i amI hang my head in my burning palms,
tears sting against my soul, searching
for the calm. Heartaches like never
before, broken, so lonely and torn.
Never to see the light, no tunnel to
be seen, sitting here alone, within my
silent screams. No hand to reach for, no
one to hold me close, I have never
felt so alone.
No one to pull me to safety, no one to
turn to, just broken hearted, searching
for life anew. No embrace, just tears
that fall down my face.
No guarantees on life or love, nothing
but dark clouds linger above. The world
tightens her grip with every breath I take,
making the next step impossible to take.
Alone in a world, the void is here, taking
over my being, taking my life, but in this
void I lose the strife. Haunting thoughts
consume me, just looking through these
tears, just wanting to be free.the flesh covers the bone
and they put a mind
in there and
sometimes a soul,
and the women break
vases against the walls
and the men drink too
much
and nobody finds the
one
but keep
looking
crawling in and out
of beds.
flesh covers
the bone and the
flesh searches
for more than
flesh.
there's no chance
at all:
we are all trapped
by a singular
fate.
nobody ever finds
the one.
the city dumps fill
the junkyards fill
the madhouses fill
the hospitals fill
the graveyards fill
nothing else
fills.
Anonymous submission.And I was alone with my thoughts.
Memories swirl in a unison of faith.
Change has been inevitably declined.
Passion bleeds from walls glittered gold.
And I was alone with my thoughts.
Recipe for destruction gilded on the page.
A gift purely given like forgotten trash.
Forever has no distinction beyond now.
And I was alone with my thoughts.
Authority is a prodigy of laziness.
Wealth measured by free-flowing barriers.
Sensuality is a brand no longer tangible.
And I was alone with my thoughts.
Swinging on a broken rope of promise.
The puddle is full of cracks.
Feminine impression embedded on the seat.
And I was alone with my thoughts.
Glistening prisms of a generation forgotten.
Barriers instilled on a broken mirror.
Reflections stagnant with happenstance.
And I was alone.
Copyright 2006 A.J. McKinleyAS I sat alone, by blue Ontario's shore,
As I mused of these mighty days, and of peace return'd, and the dead
that return no more,
A Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me;
Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America--
chant me the carol of victory;
And strike up the marches of Libertad--marches more powerful yet;
And sing me before you go, the song of the throes of Democracy.
(Democracy--the destin'd conqueror--yet treacherous lip-smiles
everywhere,
And Death and infidelity at every step.)
A Nation announcing itself,
I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,       10
I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.
A breed whose proof is in time and deeds;
What we are, we are--nativity is answer enough to objections;
We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,
We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,
We are executive in ourselves--We are sufficient in the variety of
ourselves,
We are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves;
We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world;
From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.
Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,                      20
Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or
sinful in ourselves only.
(O mother! O sisters dear!
If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us;
It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)
Have you thought there could be but a single Supreme?
There can be any number of Supremes--One does not countervail
another, any more than one eyesight countervails another, or
one life countervails another.
All is eligible to all,
All is for individuals--All is for you,
No condition is prohibited--not God's, or any.
All comes by the body--only health puts you rapport with the
universe.                                                    30
Produce great persons, the rest follows.
America isolated I sing;
I say that works made here in the spirit of other lands, are so much
poison in The States.
(How dare such insects as we see assume to write poems for America?
For our victorious armies, and the offspring following the armies?)
Piety and conformity to them that like!
Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like!
I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,
Crying, Leap from your seats, and contend for your lives!
I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning every
one I meet;                                                  40
Who are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before?
Who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?
(With pangs and cries, as thine own, O bearer of many children!
These clamors wild, to a race of pride I give.)
O lands! would you be freer than all that has ever been before?
If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to
me.
Fear grace--Fear elegance, civilization, delicatesse,
Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice;
Beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature,
Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and
men.                                                         50
Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,
America brings builders, and brings its own styles.
The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work, and
pass'd to other spheres,
A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.
America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all
hazards,
Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound--initiates the true use of
precedents,
Does not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under
their forms,
Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne
from the house,
Perceives that it waits a little while in the door--that it was
fittest for its days,
That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who
approaches,                                                  60
And that he shall be fittest for his days.
Any period, one nation must lead,
One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.
These States are the amplest poem,
Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations,
Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the
day and night,
Here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars,
Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the Soul
loves,
Here the flowing trains--here the crowds, equality, diversity, the
Soul loves.
Land of lands, and bards to corroborate!                           70
Of them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west-bred
face,
To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both mother's and
father's,
His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,
Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,
Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,
Attracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on its neck with
incomparable love,
Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,
Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in
him,
Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,
Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes--Columbia,
Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,        80
If the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, he
stretching with them north or south,
Spanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is
between them,
Growths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar,
hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood,
orange, magnolia,
Tangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,
He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with
northern transparent ice,
Off him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,
Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-
hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle;
His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and
evil,
Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,
Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,  90
Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and
muscle,
The haughty defiance of the Year 1--war, peace, the formation of the
Constitution,
The separate States, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants,
The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and
impregnable,
The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,
hunters, trappers;
Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the
gestation of new States,
Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up
from the uttermost parts;
Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially
the young men,
Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships--the gait they
have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the
presence of superiors,
The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and
decision of their phrenology,                               100
The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when
wrong'd,
The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,
good temper, and open-handedness--the whole composite make,
The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,
The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement
of the population,
The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,
Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all
points,
Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east,
north-west, south-west,
Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,
Slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the
ruins of all the rest;
On and on to the grapple with it--Assassin! then your life or ours be
the stake--and respite no more.                             110
(Lo! high toward heaven, this day,
Libertad! from the conqueress' field return'd,
I mark the new aureola around your head;
No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,
With war's flames, and the lambent lightnings playing,
And your port immovable where you stand;
With still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted
fist,
And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly
crush'd beneath you;
The menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his
senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife;
--Lo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so
much!                                                       120
To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth!
An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.)
Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive, and ever
keeps vista;
Others adorn the past--but you, O days of the present, I adorn you!
O days of the future, I believe in you! I isolate myself for your
sake;
O America, because you build for mankind, I build for you!
O well-beloved stone-cutters! I lead them who plan with decision and
science,
I lead the present with friendly hand toward the future.
Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!
But damn that which spends itself, with no thought of the stain,
pains, dismay, feebleness it is bequeathing.                130
I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,
I heard the voice arising, demanding bards;
By them, all native and grand--by them alone can The States be fused
into the compact organism of a Nation.
To hold men together by paper and seal, or by compulsion, is no
account;
That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living
principle, as the hold of the limbs of the body, or the fibres
of plants.
Of all races and eras, These States, with veins full of poetical
stuff, most need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use
them the greatest;
Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their
poets shall.
(Soul of love, and tongue of fire!
Eye to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world!
--Ah, mother! prolific and full in all besides--yet how long barren,
barren?)                                                    140
Of These States, the poet is the equable man,
Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail
of their full returns,
Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,
He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither
more nor less,
He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,
He is the equalizer of his age and land,
He supplies what wants supplying--he checks what wants checking,
In peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,
thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture,
arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the Soul, health,
immortality, government;
In war, he is the best backer of the war--he fetches artillery as
good as the engineer's--he can make every word he speaks draw
blood;
The years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by his steady
faith,                                                      150
He is no argurer, he is judgment--(Nature accepts him absolutely;)
He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a
helpless thing;
As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith,
His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,
In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,
He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,
He sees eternity in men and women--he does not see men and women as
dreams or dots.
For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,
For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,
The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign
despots.                                                    160
Without extinction is Liberty! without retrograde is Equality!
They live in the feelings of young men, and the best women;
Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always
ready to fall for Liberty.
For the great Idea!
That, O my brethren--that is the mission of Poets.
Songs of stern defiance, ever ready,
Songs of the rapid arming, and the march,
The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead, the flag we know,
Warlike flag of the great Idea.
(Angry cloth I saw there leaping!                                 170
I stand again in leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting;
I sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight--O the hard-
contested fight!
O the cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles! the hurtled balls
scream!
The battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant
from the line;
Hark! the ringing word, Charge!--now the tussle, and the furious
maddening yells;
Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,
Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,
Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)
Are you he who would assume a place to teach, or be a poet here in
The States?
The place is august--the terms obdurate.                          180
Who would assume to teach here, may well prepare himself, body and
mind,
He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe,
himself,
He shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many and stern
questions.
Who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing to America?
Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?
Have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography,
pride, freedom, friendship, of the land? its substratums and
objects?
Have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of the first
year of Independence, sign'd by the Commissioners, ratified by
The States, and read by Washington at the head of the army?
Have you possess'd yourself of the Federal Constitution?
Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them,
and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy?
Are you faithful to things? do you teach as the land and sea, the
bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, angers, teach?       190
Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?
Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls,
fierce contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the
whole people?
Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?
Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to
life itself?
Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of These States?
Have you too the old, ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?
Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity; for the
last-born? little and big? and for the errant?
What is this you bring my America?
Is it uniform with my country?
Is it not something that has been better told or done before?     200
Have you not imported this, or the spirit of it, in some ship?
Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? is the good old cause
in it?
Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,
literats, of enemies' lands?
Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?
Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?
Does it sound, with trumpet-voice, the proud victory of the Union, in
that secession war?
Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?
Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air--to appear again in my
strength, gait, face?
Have real employments contributed to it? original makers--not mere
amanuenses?
Does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, facts face to face?    210
What does it mean to me? to American persons, progresses, cities?
Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian,
native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States?
Does it encompass all The States, and the unexceptional rights of all
the men and women of the earth? (the genital impulse of These
States;)
Does it see behind the apparent custodians, the real custodians,
standing, menacing, silent--the mechanics, Manhattanese,
western men, southerners, significant alike in their apathy,
and in the promptness of their love?
Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen,
each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist,
infidel, who has ever ask'd anything of America?
What mocking and scornful negligence?
The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons;
By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.
Rhymes and rhymers pass away--poems distill'd from foreign poems pass
away,
The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes;
Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soul of
literature;                                                 220
America justifies itself, give it time--no disguise can deceive it,
or conceal from it--it is impassive enough,
Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,
If its poets appear, it will in due time advance to meet them--there
is no fear of mistake,
(The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his country
absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it.)
He masters whose spirit masters--he tastes sweetest who results
sweetest in the long run;
The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;
In the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, an
appropriate native grand-opera, shipcraft, any craft, he or she
is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical
example.
Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the
streets,
People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive
knowers; There will shortly be no more priests--I say their
work is done,                                               230
Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies
here,
Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be
superb;
Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power;
How dare you place anything before a man?
Fall behind me, States!
A man before all--myself, typical before all.
Give me the pay I have served for!
Give me to sing the song of the great Idea! take all the rest;
I have loved the earth, sun, animals--I have despised riches,
I have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid
and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others,           240
I have hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and
indulgence toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known
or unknown,
I have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the
young, and with the mothers of families,
I have read these leaves to myself in the open air--I have tried them
by trees, stars, rivers,
I have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own Soul or defiled my Body,
I have claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd
for others on the same terms,
I have sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every
State;
(In war of you, as well as peace, my suit is good, America--sadly I
boast;
Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd, to breathe his
last;
This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,
To life recalling many a prostrate form:)                         250
--I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of
myself,
I reject none, I permit all.
(Say, O mother! have I not to your thought been faithful?
Have I not, through life, kept you and yours before me?)
I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things!
It is not the earth, it is not America, who is so great,
It is I who am great, or to be great--it is you up there, or any one;
It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,
Through poems, pageants, shows, to form great individuals.
Underneath all, individuals!                                      260
I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,
The American compact is altogether with individuals,
The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,
The whole theory of the universe is directed to one single
individual--namely, to You.
(Mother! with subtle sense severe--with the naked sword in your hand,
I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)
Underneath all, nativity,
I swear I will stand by my own nativity--pious or impious, so be it;
I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity,
Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.    270
Underneath all is the need of the expression of love for men and
women,
I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing
love for men and women,
After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and
women.
I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,
(Talk as you like, he only suits These States whose manners favor the
audacity and sublime turbulence of The States.)
Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,
ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,
Underneath all, to me is myself--to you, yourself--(the same
monotonous old song.)
O I see now, flashing, that this America is only you and me,
Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,
Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me,    280
Its Congress is you and me--the officers, capitols, armies, ships,
are you and me,
Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,
The war--that war so bloody and grim--the war I will henceforth
forget--was you and me,
Natural and artificial are you and me,
Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,
Past, present, future, are you and me.
I swear I dare not shirk any part of myself,
Not any part of America, good or bad,
Not the promulgation of Liberty--not to cheer up slaves and horrify
foreign despots,
Not to build for that which builds for mankind,                   290
Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,
Not to justify science, nor the march of equality,
Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn beloved of time.
I swear I am for those that have never been master'd!
For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,
For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.
I swear I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth!
Who inaugurate one, to inaugurate all.
I swear I will not be outfaced by irrational things!
I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me!    300
I will make cities and civilizations defer to me!
This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount--and it I
teach again.
(Democracy! while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,
I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children--saw in dreams
your dilating form;
Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)
I will confront these shows of the day and night!
I will know if I am to be less than they!
I will see if I am not as majestic as they!
I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they!
I will see if I am to be less generous than they!                 310
I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have
meaning!
I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,
and I am not to be enough for myself.
I match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains,
brutes,
Copious as you are, I absorb you all in myself, and become the master
myself.
America isolated, yet embodying all, what is it finally except
myself?
These States--what are they except myself?
I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked--it is for my
sake,
I take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude forms.
(Mother! bend down, bend close to me your face!
I know not what these plots and wars, and deferments are for;     320
I know not fruition's success--but I know that through war and peace
your work goes on, and must yet go on.)
.... Thus, by blue Ontario's shore,
While the winds fann'd me, and the waves came trooping toward me,
I thrill'd with the Power's pulsations--and the charm of my theme was
upon me,
Till the tissues that held me, parted their ties upon me.
And I saw the free Souls of poets;
The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,
Strange, large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me.
O my rapt verse, my call--mock me not!
Not for the bards of the past--not to invoke them have I launch'd you
forth,                                                      330
Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,
Have I sung so capricious and loud, my savage song.
Bards for my own land, only, I invoke;
(For the war, the war is over--the field is clear'd,)
Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,
To cheer, O mother, your boundless, expectant soul.
Bards grand as these days so grand!
Bards of the great Idea! Bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the
war, the war is over!)
Yet Bards of the latent armies--a million soldiers waiting, ever-
ready,
Bards towering like hills--(no more these dots, these pigmies, these
little piping straws, these gnats, that fill the hour, to pass
for poets;)                                                 340
Bards with songs as from burning coals, or the lightning's fork'd
stripes!
Ample Ohio's bards--bards for California! inland bards--bards of the
war;)
(As a wheel turns on its axle, so I find my chants turning finally on
the war;)
Bards of pride! Bards tallying the ocean's roar, and the swooping
eagle's scream!
You, by my charm, I invoke!Call me, when you are alone
You know your voice will make my day
You know how much I wait to hear your voice
You know how much I feel for you
You know you can shun my loneliness
You know I listen to you through my tears
You know my tears brings joy to me
You know my heart has grown big
You know your heart is pressed with me
You know I have so many wishes in my heart
You know I am sitting here and thinking how to start
You know I want to send my hugs to you
You know I love you forever in so many ways
call me again and again when you are loneDon’t leave me alone,
This dark cold night,
Don’t leave me alone,
In this freezing fright,
Don’t leave me alone,
With only myself,
My sanity a fickle friend,
Who’ll soon leave,
And take my peace,
A peace, which only you restore,
So don’t leave me alone,
In the dark cold night,
Don’t leave me alone,
With this freezing fright,
Don’t leave me alone,
With what I behold in my sight,
A life with out you,
And many a freezing night.I take my wine jug out among the flowers
to drink alone, without friends.
I raise my cup to entice the moon.
That, and my shadow, makes us three.
But the moon doesn't drink,
and my shadow silently follows.
I will travel with moon and shadow,
happy to the end of spring.
When I sing, the moon dances.
When I dance, my shadow dances, too.
We share life's joys when sober.
Drunk, each goes a separate way.
Constant friends, although we wander,
we'll meet again in the Milky Way.
Li T'ai-po
tr. HamilLike the lonely winter tree
Outstretched branches with never any leaves
Lonely skeletons, with lonely smiles
They look away while trying to hide
Their outstretched lonely eyesI've pulled the last of the year's young onions.
The garden is bare now.  The ground is cold,
brown and old.  What is left of the day flames
in the maples at the corner of my
eye.  I turn, a cardinal vanishes.
By the cellar door, I wash the onions,
then drink from the icy metal spigot.
Once, years back, I walked beside my father
among the windfall pears.  I can't recall
our words.  We may have strolled in silence.  But
I still see him bend that way-left hand braced
on knee, creaky-to lift and hold to my
eye a rotten pear.  In it, a hornet
spun crazily, glazed in slow, glistening juice.
It was my father I saw this morning
waving to me from the trees.  I almost
called to him, until I came close enough
to see the shovel, leaning where I had
left it, in the flickering, deep green shade.
White rice steaming, almost done.  Sweet green peas
fried in onions.  Shrimp braised in sesame
oil and garlic.  And my own loneliness.
What more could I, a young man, want.Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.
Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,
And lay them prone upon the earth and cease
To ponder on themselves, the while they stare
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
From dusty bondage into luminous air.
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,
When first the shaft into his vision shone
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they
Who, though once only and then but far away,
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.Life is the cage
We are all born into
The zoo
Drives down the long
Snake in the rain,
Everyone sits alone
In the park
In the car
In the theatre
Everyone sits alone
And looks through bars
Of their flesh and bone
No eager hand
can grasp out of this
No willing hand has the
Reach,
We touch our flesh
To the flesh of our cages,
We lay down chained
And little birds sing
Beside others miles away
And barking
We touch steering wheels
As the lights cross our eyes
We learn to believe
The birth of shadows
We drive, a line of slaves,
Down the road
Everyone sits alone.ONE face alone, one face alone,
These eyes require;
But, when that long’d-for sight is shown,
What fatal fire
Shoots through my veins a keen and liquid flame,
That melts each fibre of my wasting frame!
One voice alone, one voice alone,
I pine to hear;
But, when its meek mellifluous tone
Usurps mine ear,
Those slavish chains about my soul are wound,
Which ne’er, till death itself, can be unbound.
One gentle hand, one gentle hand,
I fain would hold;
But, when it seems at my command,
My own grows cold;
Then low to earth I bend in sickly swoon,
Like lilies drooping ’mid the blaze of noon.The young maricones and the horny muchachas,
The big fat widows delirious from insomnia,
The young wives thirty hours' pregnant,
And the hoarse tomcats that cross my garden at night,
Like a collar of palpitating sexual oysters
Surround my solitary home,
Enemies of my soul,
Conspirators in pajamas
Who exchange deep kisses for passwords.
Radiant summer brings out the lovers
In melancholy regiments,
Fat and thin and happy and sad couples;
Under the elegant coconut palms, near the ocean and moon,
There is a continual life of pants and panties,
A hum from the fondling of silk stockings,
And women's breasts that glisten like eyes.
The salary man, after a while,
After the week's tedium, and the novels read in bed at night,
Has decisively fucked his neighbor,
And now takes her to the miserable movies,
Where the heroes are horses or passionate princes,
And he caresses her legs covered with sweet down
With his ardent and sweaty palms that smell like cigarettes.
The night of the hunter and the night of the husband
Come together like bed sheets and bury me,
And the hours after lunch, when the students and priests are masturbating,
And the animals mount each other openly,
And the bees smell of blood, and the flies buzz cholerically,
And cousins play strange games with cousins,
And doctors glower at the husband of the young patient,
And the early morning in which the professor, without a thought,
Pays his conjugal debt and eats breakfast,
And to top it all off, the adulterers, who love each other truly
On beds big and tall as ships:
So, eternally,
This twisted and breathing forest crushes me
With gigantic flowers like mouth and teeth
And black roots like fingernails and shoes.
Translated by Mike ToppHe stands alone now etched by time
As though was meant to be
His frame all bent and twisted
For all who pass to see
It wasn't always as it is
When children came around
To run and laugh and shriek with glee
He revelled in the sound
But age and weather took its toll
And disease had hit him hard
A surgeons cuts had saved his life
For which he didn't charge
And so he stands alone but proud
To survey what could be seen
The only oak for miles around
Upon the village green.There was darkness under Heaven
For an hour's space--
Darkness that we knew was given
Us for special grace.
Sun and noon and stars were hid,
God had left His Throne,
When Helen came to me, she did,
Helen all alone!
Side by side (because our fate
Damned us ere our birth)
We stole out of Limbo Gate
Looking for the Earth.
Hand in pulling hand amid
Fear no dreams have known,
Helen ran with me, she did,
Helen all alone!
When the Horror passing speech
Hunted us along,
Each laid hold on each, and each
Found the other strong.
In the teeth of Things forbid
And Reason overthrown,
Helen stood by me, she did,
Helen all alone!
When, at last, we heard those Fires
Dull and die away,
When, at last, our linked desires
Dragged us up to day;
When, at last, our souls were rid
Of what that Night had shown,
Helen passed from me, she did,
Helen all alone!
Let her go and find a mate,
As I will find a bride,
Knowing naught of Limbo Gate
Or Who are penned inside.
There is knowledge God forbid
More than one should own.
So Helen went from me, she did,
Oh, my soul, be glad she did!
Helen all alone!My family drove off mere hours ago
to visit Grandma on her birthday,
thus I am home and quite all alone.
First thing I undertook post-farewell
was doff my duds down to the undies,
hotter, t'was, than Homer Simpson's hell.
Ne'er may I dance to song as I please - -
tho' the spirit may often move me,
for my kin fling up arms, shriek and tease.
My feet like to dance, so, dance I did,
with the family van well out of view.
Sometimes you must blindly trust your id!
I danced like a fiend, singing along,
as graceful as Elaine on 'Seinfeld',
free as a bird both in movement and song...
Exhausted
at last,
I realized - -
a mite
too late
that
in my half-
sorrowful/
all-ecstatic
state
I'd undressed
while still
in front
of
the
house...
SOB (to say the least, eh?)
I fell dumbly to my knees,
clothes GONE from the grass!
Finding the door securely locked,
I spontaneously combusted into ash h h..........
Not really...
I'm hiding beneath
the deck until their
return in days three
using heretofore
unknown mental
powers to post this
poem on PH with glee!
So what - -
I'm
hungry.Oh, once I walked in Heaven, all alone
Upon the sacred cliffs above the sky.
God and the angels, and the gleaming saints
Had journeyed out into the stars to die.
They had gone forth to win far citizens,
Bought at great price, bring happiness for all:
By such a harvest make a holier town
And put new life within old Zion's wall.
Each chose a far-off planet for his home,
Speaking of love and mercy, truth and right,
Envied and cursed, thorn-crowned and scourged in time,
Each tasted death on his appointed night.
Then resurrection day from sphere to sphere
Sped on, with all the POWERS arisen again,
While with them came in clouds recruited hosts
Of sun-born strangers and of earth-born men.
And on that day gray prophet saints went down
And poured atoning blood upon the deep,
Till every warrior of old Hell flew free
And all the torture fires were laid asleep.
And Hell's lost company I saw return
Clear-eyed, with plumes of white, the demons bold
Climbed with the angels now on Jacob's stair,
And built a better Zion than the old.
And yet I walked alone on azure cliffs
A lifetime long, and loved each untrimmed vine:
The rotted harps, the swords of rusted gold,
The jungles of all Heaven then were mine.
Oh mesas and throne-mountains that I found!
Oh strange and shaking thoughts that touched me there,
Ere I beheld the bright returning wings
That came to spoil my secret, silent lair!I am much too alone in this world, yet not alone
enough
to truly consecrate the hour.
I am much too small in this world, yet not small
enough
to be to you just object and thing,
dark and smart.
I want my free will and want it accompanying
the path which leads to action;
and want during times that beg questions,
where something is up,
to be among those in the know,
or else be alone.
I want to mirror your image to its fullest perfection,
never be blind or too old
to uphold your weighty wavering reflection.
I want to unfold.
Nowhere I wish to stay crooked, bent;
for there I would be dishonest, untrue.
I want my conscience to be
true before you;
want to describe myself like a picture I observed
for a long time, one close up,
like a new word I learned and embraced,
like the everday jug,
like my mother's face,
like a ship that carried me along
through the deadliest storm.I was born a wild child
a navigators son
from the slums I took my chances
and was always on the run
fought my way with others like me
and society who blamed
my behaviour on my parents
and misfortune on my name
I bled for my existence
and stole to feed my need
I would put on many faces
to extrapolate my breed
to defend the others round me
and provide some hopeful care
to the familys with broken hearts
and dreams that went nowhere
In the darkness of a thousand scars
that tore away my flesh
my hands would reach into
the soul and bones of what I'm worth
and though the sun was shining
trying to brighten up the day
in the poverty of mouths to feed
the slums are always grey
In a history of violence
and the screams that no-one heard
in a mothers tears and fathers fears
I learned every word
and paraded with a vengeance
on the streets of cobblestones
that my heart was independant
and I didn't stand alone.Alone I set out on the road;
The flinty path is sparkling in the mist;
The night is still. The desert harks to God,
And star with star converses.
The vault is overwhelmed with solemn wonder
The earth in cobalt aura sleeps. . .
Why do I feel so pained and troubled?
What do I harbor: hope, regrets?
I see no hope in years to come,
Have no regrets for things gone by.
All that I seek is peace and freedom!
To lose myself and sleep!
But not the frozen slumber of the grave...
I'd like eternal sleep to leave
My life force dozing in my breast
Gently with my breath to rise and fall;
By night and day, my hearing would be soothed
By voices sweet, singing to me of love.
And over me, forever green,
A dark oak tree would bend and rustle.I tell you that I see her still
At the dark entrance of the hall.
One gas lamp burning near her shoulder
Shone also from her other side
Where hung the long inaccurate glass
Whose pictures were as troubled water.
An immense shadow had its hand
Between us on the floor, and seemed
To hump the knuckles nervously,
A giant crab readying to walk,
Or a blanket moving in its sleep.
You will remember, with a smile
Instructed by movies to reminisce,
How strict her corsets must have been,
How the huge arrangements of her hair
Would certainly betray the least
Impassionate displacement there.
It was no rig for dallying,
And maybe only marriage could
Derange that queenly scaffolding -
As when a great ship, coming home,
Coasts in the harbor, dropping sail
And loosing all the tackle that had laced
Her in the long lanes...
I know
We need not draw this figure out
But all that whalebone came for whales
And all the whales lived in the sea,
In calm beneath the troubled glass,
Until the needle drew their blood.
I see her standing in the hall,
Where the mirror's lashed to blood and foam,
And the black flukes of agony
Beat at the air till the light blows out.I THOUGHT I was not alone, walking here by the shore,
But the one I thought was with me, as now I walk by the shore,
As I lean and look through the glimmering light--that one has utterly
disappeared,
And those appear that perplex me.I walk alone amongst the crowd
My heart still bleeding, pounding loud
Through darkened streets, I walk alone
I have no one to call my own
I need someone to ease the pain
To stop these tears that fall like rain
Alone I walk
To myself I talk
My teers tear apart
My broken heart
Charles R. BruntyI woke alone,
ignorant of your absence.
I woke alone,
knowing what I can not have.
I will wake alone,
remembering what could have been.I cry
On a remote mountainside,
Tears impossible to hide
From the mysterious, compassionate
Eyes of God;
I spend so much time alone,
But maybe I’m not alone.In the beginning our Father was alone wanting company.
So to Himself said, 'I'll just create friends to suit my fancy.'
They will all be Holy angels having freedom of choice.
These Holy angels will be perfect in beauty having a voice.
All these angelic beings will have wings to fly away.
But I will set boundaries and limits where they are to stay.
They will also have eyes to see where to stop.
With ears to hear praises from the top.
By now the angels were given the sense of touch.
To the hierarchy in Heaven, was loved very much.
This sense of touch could be the feel of a wheel.
Boy what a deal.
And among other things could be pleasure,
With God's measure.
This pleasure with God's measure,
was their treasure.
All these spirits were given a mind.
To especially be kind.
Possessing abilities to voice their choice.
Think at a blink, even wink, not blind.
Hearing with ears even from behind.
The rank of the Cherubim was made of winged little girls and boys.
These Cherubs walked and talked with God who gave them toys.
The boys played with balls.
The girls played with dolls.
These Cherubs were happy, being content with all.
God was pleased with what He saw.
God gave all angels senses of smell and taste.
Instructing them they could lick in haste.
But never to taste paste or waste.
God gave angels given knowledge.
This sixth sense not taught in college.
The wisdom acquired,
Will be required.
If so desired.
So stay chaste.
For the chase.
Being eternally chased.
At this time there was no sin, which is vice.
Everything in Heavens chorus was joyous and nice.
Our Father is Perfect So He didn't have to think twice.
He made no mistakes that could not be corrected.
When creating He got exactly what He expected.
Through His Perfection is why God is always respected.
Every thing God created,
Never became outdated.
He could raise His finger,
To invent some timber.
Or blink an eye,
Creating the sky.
That Perfect magic Man could make something,
Simply out of nothing.
God created no two things exactly the same.
A female angel by nickname,
Was called a dame.
God could create showers,
For all the flowers.
What was left of the rain,
Ran down the drain.
After these showers.
The man took to the dame.
As a gift, these flowers.
For the main spirit game,
Was to win the dame.
Then your spirit life and her name.
Would never be the same.Come, my darling, come away,
Take a pretty walk to-day;
Run along, and never fear,
I'll take care of baby dear:
Up and down with little feet,
That's the way to walk, my sweet.
Now it is so very near,
Soon she'll get to mother dear.
There she comes along at last:
Here's my finger, hold it fast:
Now one pretty little kiss,
After such a walk as this.I’d like to awake
Without being woken
To just sit and think
With no word spoken
Allow me some time
To have on my own
When no one comes round
Or calls on the phone
I’d just like some space
Some privacy for me
I’d like to be left
With no company
To go to the bathroom
And not be disturbed
To put on my hairdryer
Without being heard
To lay in my bed
Minus the dogs
To cruise round the house
Without any tog’s
Let doors that I shut
Remain unopened
And none of my things
Be moved or broken
A special room
To call my own
A private place
To be alone
Lay back, relax
Chill out, just be
With no one else
Except for me.If God has been good enough to give you a poet
Then listen to him. But for God's sake let him alone until he is dead;
no prizes, no ceremony,
They kill the man. A poet is one who listens
To nature and his own heart; and if the noise of the world grows up
around him, and if he is tough enough,
He can shake off his enemies, but not his friends.
That is what withered Wordsworth and muffled Tennyson, and would have
killed Keats; that is what makes
Hemingway play the fool and Faulkner forget his art.826
Love reckons by itself—alone—
"As large as I"—relate the Sun
To One who never felt it blaze—
Itself is all the like it has—Love walked alone.
The rocks cut her tender feet,
And the brambles tore her fair limbs.
There came a companion to her,
But, alas, he was no help,
For his name was heart's pain. .It is yourself you seek
In a long rage,
Scanning through light and darkness
Mirrors, the page,
Where should reflected be
Those eyes and that thick hair,
That passionate look, that laughter.
You should appear
Within the book, or doubled,
Freed, in the silvered glass;
Into all other bodies
Yourself should pass.
The glass does not dissolve;
Like walls the mirrors stand;
The printed page gives back
Words by another hand.
And your infatuate eye
Meets not itself below;
Strangers lie in your arms
As I lie now.*inspired when I was doing slavery in class
-------
These chains that bind my body,
Shall not bind my mind,
The skin taken from my flesh,
Shall not blind my sight,
These tears they shall not spill,
Till wrongs and rights are justed,
The dirt upon the my knees,
Is not my souls one colour,
My body you may own,
My mind is mine alone,
My soul it nests in His hands,
My life is mine alone.My heart feels like an empty shell
Washed up from the sea
My mind feels like it's going mad
From trying to break free
And my tears seem like a thousand oceans
And they're drowning all the bliss
And my lips ache to be touched
By a true loves kiss
But I'm not aloneTo be with people
Not feel lonely
To be with oneself
Not feel aloneON the beach at night alone,
As the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her husky song,
As I watch the bright stars shining--I think a thought of the clef of
the universes, and of the future.
A VAST SIMILITUDE interlocks all,
All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
comets, asteroids,
All the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the
same,
All distances of place, however wide,
All distances of time--all inanimate forms,
All Souls--all living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in
different worlds,
All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes--the fishes, the
brutes,                                                      10
All men and women--me also;
All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages;
All identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any
globe;
All lives and deaths--all of the past, present, future;
This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd, and shall
forever span them, and compactly hold them, and enclose them.ROOTS and leaves themselves alone are these;
Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods, and from the
pond-side,
Breast-sorrel and pinks of love--fingers that wind around tighter
than vines,
Gushes from the throats of birds, hid in the foliage of trees, as the
sun is risen;
Breezes of land and love--breezes set from living shores out to you
on the living sea--to you, O sailors!
Frost-mellow'd berries, and Third-month twigs, offer'd fresh to young
persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up,
Love-buds, put before you and within you, whoever you are,
Buds to be unfolded on the old terms;
If you bring the warmth of the sun to them, they will open, and bring
form, color, perfume, to you;
If you become the aliment and the wet, they will become flowers,
fruits, tall blanches and trees.                             10So alone in my bed
Alone listening to nightly whispers
Alone in my thoughts
Alone standing in court
Alone I stand and fight
Alone I pray for rainbow lights
Alone in the morning I awake
Alone I celebrate my joys
Alone I cry out my sadness
Alone I voice out my fears
Alone in strenght
Alone in wealth
Alone in good health
Alone I try to understand
Alone I seek knowledge
Alone I share what is mine
Alone I try not to be alone
Alone when my time has come, I pass awayWhilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.You not alone, when you are still alone,
O God, from you that I could private be.
Since you one were, I never since was one;
Since you in me, my self since out of me,
Transported from my self into your being;
Though either distant, present yet to either,
Senseless with too much joy, each other seeing,
And only absent when we are together.
Give me my self and take your self again,
Devise some means but how I may forsake you;
So much is mine that doth with you remain,
That, taking what is mine, with me I take you;
You do bewitch me; O, that I could fly
From my self you, or from your own self I.Sitting alone, Love bids me go and write;
Reason plucks back, commanding me to stay,
Boasting that she doth still direct the way,
Or else Love were unable to endite.
Love, growing angry, vexed at the spleen
And scorning Reason's maimed argument,
Straight taxeth Reason, wanting to invent,
Where she with Love conversing hath not been.
Reason, reproached with this coy disdain,
Despiteth Love, and laugheth at her folly;
And Love, condemning Reason's reason wholly,
Thought it in weight too light by many'a grain.
Reason, put back, doth out of sight remove,
And Love alone picks reason out of love.When I go alone at night to my
love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind
does not stir, the houses on both sides
of the street stand silent.
It is my own anklets that grow loud
at every step and I am ashamed.
When I sit on my balcony and listen
for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle
on the trees, and the water is still in
the river like the sword on the knees
of a sentry fallen asleep.
It is my own heart that beats wildly
--I do not know how to quiet it.
When my love comes and sits by
my side, when my body trembles and
my eyelids droop, the night darkens,
the wind blows out the lamp, and the
clouds draw veils over the stars.
It is the jewel at my own breast
that shines and gives light. I do not
know how to hide it.Scarlet as the cloth draped over a sword,
white as steaming rice, blue as leschenaultia,
old curried towns, the frog in its green human skin;
a ploughman walking his furrow as if in irons, but
as at a whoop of young men running loose
in brick passages, there occurred the thought
like instant stitches all through crumpled silk:
as if he'd had to leap to catch the bullet.
A stench like hands out of the ground.
The willows had like beads in their hair, and
Peenemünde, grunted the dentist's drill, Peenemünde!
Fowls went on typing on every corn key, green
kept crowding the pinks of the peach trees into the sky
but used speech balloons were tacky in the river
and waterbirds had liftoff as at a repeal of gravity.There is no place or grace, for all the human race
The race of will, to race and kill
As anger fills and kills the thrill
That we hold near and dear, we cherished children fear
The wraith of God, the wraith of man
The wraith of future shines the plan
That we can maul it all, from front to back we saw
The answer here, the answer there
And never thought to question where
Did anger’s state of hate, combined collaborate
That one is right, and powering
Then one will fight for might to sing
The battle long of song, dividing right from wrong
The death of you, the death of me
The death of us for all to see
No one can own this bone, together we’re aloneWhen I am alone, I think about you
I think how much we are close to each other
even we are far distance
I think our love is in our hearts
I think the good time we've shared together
I think how important you are
I think to share my ideas with you
I think my last dance with you
I think of my last kiss to you
I think your love on me
I think about you everyday
and wanted to let you know
I remember you when I am aloneWhen I walk alone, I think of you my love
When I walk alone, I walk with broken heart
When I walk alone, I walk with sadness
When I walk alone, I walk with my silent tears
When I walk alone, I walk with my sorrow
When I walk alone, I walk with my sad memories
When I walk alone, I walk with my shattered dream
When I walk alone, I walk with my hands lifeless
Love never walk alone but you made me walk alone
You promised me that you will walk with me forever
but you made me walk alone with my tears forever
When the heaven stolen you from me yesterday
All your promises are gone with the wind
Today, You made me walk alone with out you my love
and I promise you, I will walk alone till my journey endsYou alone I love, you alone I worship. [Poem]
Until I die my breath will guard you,
And my memories after.
In my death none I like to weep for me,
If you shed a dropp of tear, I will sprout again from the mud.
To love you to guard you to serve you.
I am born to love you alone
And I will die for your love too.
In the world here after, I will love, love you alone.
What else shall I say when my love for you is full?
What shall I think but you  when you are the truth.
I will but love you, Let them stone at me.
You alone I love, you alone I worship.
I m made to sing your melodies, care not the world hear or not.
Until I die my breath will guard you,
And my memories after.
In my death none I like to weep for me,
If you shed a dropp of tear, I will sprout again from the mud.
To love you to guard you to serve you.Will a friend fly here
Among the gulls that glide and cry,
And erase all the mortification
Just to end this life's taxation?
Will a friend float here
Among the waves that rise and fall,
And break upon the rocks
To shatter lies that stand tall?
Will a friend walk here
Among the numerous passerbys
And fight for my rights
On all the days and nights?
Will a friend swim here
Among the sharks that create terror and fear
With strength and courage
Just to save my jagged life?
Or will I sit and sob
Among the winds that swirl and twirl
Only to unfurl
A life with beauty all around
But no human support to surround.
Does that mean all I can do is moan and groan
And nevertheless be on my own - ALL ALONE?

---Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3---Freedom, equality and justice
Had been the most valuable treasures
Cherished in the American hearts
And were the basis of their politics.
Religion also played its vital role,
Well among the American people,
But more than the spiritual progress,
Material value occupied the first place.
The reason was, the tremendous
Progress in technology and science,
That increased their prospects
Besides their rich life styles.
To give America a religious flavor,
Efforts were made thereafter.
As in the Parliament of Religion,
A forum to study all religions.
This forum gave a chance
For every religion to place
Their best religious practices
Before the learned audience.
Vivekananda scored high marks
In this evaluation process
To the credit of the Hindus,
With his thundering lectures.
He kept America in high esteem
For having extended this forum
To all the world religions
In the name of Parliament of Religions.
This forum proved that the success
Of technology and science
Responsible for material prosperity,
Couldn’t destroy any spiritual activity.
The result was, a closer contact
Between the East and the West
On the material platform
As well as in the spiritual forum.
In the eyes of America
The prestige of India
Shot up by leaps and bounds
Only after Swamiji’s lectures.I.
ADIEU, New-England's smiling meads,
Adieu, the flow'ry plain:
I leave thine op'ning charms, O spring,
And tempt the roaring main.
II.
In vain for me the flow'rets rise,
And boast their gaudy pride,
While here beneath the northern skies
I mourn for health deny'd.
III.
Celestial maid of rosy hue,
O let me feel thy reign!
I languish till thy face I view,
Thy vanish'd joys regain.
IV.
Susanna mourns, nor can I bear
To see the crystal show'r,
Or mark the tender falling tear
At sad departure's hour;
V.
Not unregarding can I see
Her soul with grief opprest:
But let no sighs, no groans for me,
Steal from her pensive breast.
VI.
In vain the feather'd warblers sing,
In vain the garden blooms,
And on the bosom of the spring
Breathes out her sweet perfumes.
VII.
While for Britannia's distant shore
We sweep the liquid plain,
And with astonish'd eyes explore
The wide-extended main.
VIII.
Lo! Health appears! celestial dame!
Complacent and serene,
With Hebe's mantle o'er her Frame,
With soul-delighting mein.
IX.
To mark the vale where London lies
With misty vapours crown'd,
Which cloud Aurora's thousand dyes,
And veil her charms around.
X.
Why, Phoebus, moves thy car so slow?
So slow thy rising ray?
Give us the famous town to view,
Thou glorious king of day!
XI.
For thee, Britannia, I resign
New-England's smiling fields;
To view again her charms divine,
What joy the prospect yields!
XII.
But thou!  Temptation hence away,
With all thy fatal train,
Nor once seduce my soul away,
By thine enchanting strain.
XIII.
Thrice happy they, whose heav'nly shield
Secures their souls from harms,
And fell Temptation on the field
Of all its pow'r disarms!You have the grit and the guts, I know;
You are ready to answer blow for blow
You are virile, combative, stubborn, hard,
But your honor ends with your own back-yard;
Each man intent on his private goal,
You have no feeling for the whole;
What singly none would tolerate
You let unpunished hit the state,
Unmindful that each man must share
The stain he lets his country wear,
And (what no traveller ignores)
That her good name is often yours.
You are proud in the pride that feels its might;
From your imaginary height
Men of another race or hue
Are men of a lesser breed to you:
The neighbor at your southern gate
You treat with the scorn that has bred his hate.
To lend a spice to your disrespect
You call him the "greaser". But reflect!
The greaser has spat on you more than once;
He has handed you multiple affronts;
He has robbed you, banished you, burned and killed;
He has gone untrounced for the blood he spilled;
He has jeering used for his bootblack's rag
The stars and stripes of the gringo's flag;
And you, in the depths of your easy-chair --
What did you do, what did you care?
Did you find the season too cold and damp
To change the counter for the camp?
Were you frightened by fevers in Mexico?
I can't imagine, but this I know --
You are impassioned vastly more
By the news of the daily baseball score
Than to hear that a dozen countrymen
Have perished somewhere in Darien,
That greasers have taken their innocent lives
And robbed their holdings and raped their wives.
Not by rough tongues and ready fists
Can you hope to jilt in the modern lists.
The armies of a littler folk
Shall pass you under the victor's yoke,
Sobeit a nation that trains her sons
To ride their horses and point their guns --
Sobeit a people that comprehends
The limit where private pleasure ends
And where their public dues begin,
A people made strong by discipline
Who are willing to give -- what you've no mind to --
And understand -- what you are blind to --
The things that the individual
Must sacrifice for the good of all.
You have a leader who knows -- the man
Most fit to be called American,
A prophet that once in generations
Is given to point to erring nations
Brighter ideals toward which to press
And lead them out of the wilderness.
Will you turn your back on him once again?
Will you give the tiller once more to men
Who have made your country the laughing-stock
For the older peoples to scorn and mock,
Who would make you servile, despised, and weak,
A country that turns the other cheek,
Who care not how bravely your flag may float,
Who answer an insult with a note,
Whose way is the easy way in all,
And, seeing that polished arms appal
Their marrow of milk-fed pacifist,
Would tell you menace does not exist?
Are these, in the world's great parliament,
The men you would choose to represent
Your honor, your manhood, and your pride,
And the virtues your fathers dignified?
Oh, bury them deeper than the sea
In universal obloquy;
Forget the ground where they lie, or write
For epitaph: "Too proud to fight."
I have been too long from my country's shores
To reckon what state of mind is yours,
But as for myself I know right well
I would go through fire and shot and shell
And face new perils and make my bed
In new privations, if ROOSEVELT led;
But I have given my heart and hand
To serve, in serving another land,
Ideals kept bright that with you are dim;
Here men can thrill to their country's hymn,
For the passion that wells in the Marseillaise
Is the same that fires the French these days,
And, when the flag that they love goes by,
With swelling bosom and moistened eye
They can look, for they know that it floats there still
By the might of their hands and the strength of their will,
And through perils countless and trials unknown
Its honor each man has made his own.
They wanted the war no more than you,
But they saw how the certain menace grew,
And they gave two years of their youth or three
The more to insure their liberty
When the wrath of rifles and pennoned spears
Should roll like a flood on their wrecked frontiers.
They wanted the war no more than you,
But when the dreadful summons blew
And the time to settle the quarrel came
They sprang to their guns, each man was game;
And mark if they fight not to the last
For their hearths, their altars, and their past:
Yea, fight till their veins have been bled dry
For love of the country that WILL not die.
O friends, in your fortunate present ease
(Yet faced by the self-same facts as these),
If you would see how a race can soar
That has no love, but no fear, of war,
How each can turn from his private role
That all may act as a perfect whole,
How men can live up to the place they claim
And a nation, jealous of its good name,
Be true to its proud inheritance,
Oh, look over here and learn from FRANCE!LEANDER.
No more of Memphis and her mighty kings,
Or Alexandria, where the Ptolomies.
Taught golden commerce to unfurl her falls,
And bid fair science smile: No more of Greece
Where learning next her early visit paid,
And spread her glories to illume the world,
No more of Athens, where she flourished,
And saw her sons of mighty genius rise
Smooth flowing Plato, Socrates and him
Who with resistless eloquence reviv'd
The Spir't of Liberty, and shook the thrones
Of Macedon and Persia's haughty king.
No more of Rome enlighten'd by her beams,
Fresh kindling there the fire of eloquence,
And poesy divine; imperial Rome!
Whose wide dominion reach'd o'er half the globe;
Whose eagle flew o'er Ganges to the East,
And in the West far to the British isles.
No more of Britain, and her kings renown'd,
Edward's and Henry's thunderbolts of war;
Her chiefs victorious o'er the Gallic foe;
Illustrious senators, immortal bards,
And wise philosophers, of these no more.
A Theme more new, tho' not less noble claims
Our ev'ry thought on this auspicious day
The rising glory of this western world,
Where now the dawning light of science spreads
Her orient ray, and wakes the muse's song;
Where freedom holds her sacred standard high,
And commerce rolls her golden tides profuse
Of elegance and ev'ry joy of life.
ACASTO.
Since then Leander you attempt a strain
So new, so noble and so full of fame;
And since a friendly concourse centers here
America's own sons, begin O muse!
Now thro' the veil of ancient days review
The period fam'd when first Columbus touch'd
The shore so long unknown, thro' various toils,
Famine and death, the hero made his way,
Thro' oceans bestowing with eternal storms.
But why, thus hap'ly found, should we resume
The tale of Cortez, furious chief, ordain'd
With Indian blood to dye the sands, and choak
Fam'd Amazonia's stream with dead! Or why,
Once more revive the story old in fame,
Of Atabilipa by thirst of gold
Depriv'd of life: which not Peru's rich ore,
Nor Mexico's vast mines cou'd then redeem.
Better these northern realms deserve our song,
Discover'd by Britannia for her sons;
Undeluged with seas of Indian blood,
Which cruel Spain on southern regions spilt;
To gain by terrors what the gen'rous breast
Wins by fair treaty, conquers without blood.
EUGENIO.
High in renown th' intreprid hero stands,
From Europes shores advent'ring first to try
New seas, new oceans, unexplor'd by man.
Fam'd Cabot too may claim our noblest song,
Who from th' Atlantic surge descry'd these shores,
As on he coasted from the Mexic bay
To Acady and piny Labradore.
Nor less than him the muse would celebrate
Bold Hudson stemming to the pole, thro' seas
Vex'd with continual storms, thro' the cold strains,
Where Europe and America oppose
Their shores contiguous, and the northern sea
Confin'd, indignant, swells and roars between.
With these be number'd in the list of fame
Illustrious Raleigh, hapless in his fate:
Forgive me Raleigh, if an infant muse
Borrows thy name to grace her humble strain;
By many nobler are thy virtues sung;
Envy no more shall throw them in the shade;
They pour new lustre on Britannia's isle.
Thou too, advent'rous on th' Atlantic main,
Burst thro' its storms and fair Virginia hail'd.
The simple natives saw thy canvas flow,
And gaz'd aloof upon the shady shore:
For in her woods America contain'd,
From times remote, a savage race of men.
How shall we know their origin, how tell,
From whence or where the Indian tribes arose?
ACASTO.
And long has this defy'd the sages skill
T' investigate: Tradition seems to hide
The mighty secret from each mortal eye,
How first these various nations South and North
Possest these shores, or from what countries came.
Whether they sprang from some premoeval head
In their own lands, like Adam in the East;
Yet this the sacred oracles deny,
And reason too reclaims against the thought.
For when the gen'ral deluge drown'd the world,
Where could their tribes have found security?
Where find their fate but in the ghastly deep?
Unless, as others dream, some chosen few
High on the Andes 'scap'd the gen'ral death,
High on the Andes wrapt in endless snow,
Where winter in his wildest fury reigns.
But here Philosophers oppose the scheme,
The earth, say they, nor hills nor mountains knew
E'er yet the universal flood prevail'd:
But when the mighty waters rose aloft
Rous'd by the winds, they shook their solid case
And in convulsions tore the drowned world!
'Till by the winds assuag'd they quickly fell
And all their ragged bed exposed to view.
Perhaps far wand'ring towards the northren pole,
The straits of Zembla and the Frozen Zone,
And where the eastern Greenland almost joins
America's north point, the hardy tribes
Of banish'd Jews, Siberians, Tartars wild
Came over icy mountains, or on floats
First reach'd these coasts hid from the world beside.
And yet another argument more strange
Reserv'd for men of deeper thought and late
Presents itself to view: In Pelag's days,
So says the Hebrew seer's inspired pen,
This mighty mass of earth, this solid globe
Was cleft in twain--cleft east and west apart
While strait between the deep Atlantic roll'd.
And traces indisputable remain
Of this unhappy land now sunk and lost;
The islands rising in the eastern main
Are but small fragments of this continent,
Whose two extremities were Newfoudland
And St. Helena.--One far in the north
Where British seamen now with strange surprise
Behold the pole star glitt'ring o'er their heads;
The other in the southern tropic rears
Its head above the waves; Bermudas and
Canary isles, Britannia and th' Azores,
With fam'd Hibernia are but broken parts
Of some prodigious waste which once sustain'd
Armies by lands, where now but ships can range.
LEANDER.
Your sophistry Acasto makes me smile;
The roving mind of man delights to dwell
On hidden things, merely because they're hid;
He thinks his knowledge ne'er can reach too high
And boldly pierces nature's inmost haunts
But for uncertainties; your broken isles,
You northern Tartars, and your wand'ring Jews.
Hear what the voice of history proclaims.
The Carthaginians, e'er the Roman yoke
Broke their proud spirits and enslav'd them too,
For navigation were renown'd as much
As haughty Tyre with all her hundred fleets;
Full many: league their vent'rous seamen sail'd
Thro' strait Gibraltar down the western shore
Of Africa, and to Canary isles
By them call'd fortunate, so Flaccus sings,
Because eternal spring there crowns the fields,
And fruits delicious bloom throughout the year.
From voyaging here this inference I draw,
Perhaps some barque with all her num'rous crew
Caught by the eastern trade wind hurry'd on
Before th' steady blast to Brazil's shore,
New Amazonia and the coasts more south.
Here standing and unable to return,
For ever from their native skies estrang'd,
Doubtless they made the unknown land their own.
And in the course of many rolling years
A num'rous progeny from these arose,
And spread throughout the coasts; those whom we call
Brazilians, Mexicans, Peruvians rich,
Th' tribes of Chili, Paragon and those
Who till the shores of Amazon's long stream.
When first the pow'rs of Europe here attain'd
Vast empires, kingdoms, cities, palaces
And polish'd nations stock'd the fertile land.
Who has not heard of Cusco, Lima and
The town of Mexico; huge cities form'd
From Europe's architecture, e're the arms
Of haughty Spain disturb'd the peaceful soil.
EUGENIO.
Such disquisition leads the puzzled mind
From maze to maze by queries still perplex'd.
But this we know, if from the east they came
Where science first and revelation beam'd,
Long since they've lost all memory, all trace
Of this their origin: Tradition tells
Of some great forefather beyond the lakes
Oswego, Huron, Mechigan, Champlaine
Or by the stream of Amazon which rolls
Thro' many a clime; while others simply dream
That from the Andes or the mountains north,
Some hoary fabled ancestor came down
To people this their world.
LEANDER.
How fallen, Oh!
How much obscur'd is human nature here!
Shut from the light of science and of truth
They wander'd blindfold down the steep of time;
Dim superstition with her ghastly train
Of dæmons, spectres and forboding signs
Still urging them to horrid rites and forms
Of human sacrifice, to sooth the pow'rs
Malignant, and the dark infernal king.
Once on this spot perhaps a wigwam stood
With all its rude inhabitants, or round
Some mighty fire an hundred savage sons
Gambol'd by day, and filled the night with cries;
In what superior to the brutal race
That fled before them thro' the howling wilds,
Were all those num'rous tawny tribes which swarm'd
From Baffin's bay to Del Fuego south,
From California to the Oronoque.
Far from the reach of fame they liv'd unknown
In listless slumber and inglorious ease;
To them fair science never op'd her stores,
Nor sacred truth sublim'd the soul to God;
No fix'd abode their wand'ring genius knew;
No golden harvest crown'd the fertile glebe;
No city then adorn'd the rivers bank,
Nor rising turret overlook'd the stream.
ACASTO.
Now view the prospect chang'd; far off at sea
The mariner descry's our spacious towns
He hails the prospect of the land and views
A new, a fair a fertile world arise;
Onward from India's isles far east, to us
Now fair-ey'd commerce stretches her white sails,
Learning exalts her head, the graces smile
And peace establish'd after horrid war
Improves the splendor of these early times.
But come my friends and let us trace the steps
By which this recent happy world arose,
To this fair eminence of high renown
This height of wealth, of liberty and fame.
LEANDER.
Speak then Eugenio, for I've heard you tell
The pleasing hist'ry, and the cause that brought
The first advent'rers to these happy shores;
The glorious cause that urg'd our fathers first
To visit climes unknown and wilder woods
Than e'er Tartarian or Norwegian saw,
And with fair culture to adorn that soil
Which never knew th' industrious swain before.
EUGENIO.
All this long story to rehearse would tire,
Besides the sun toward the west retreats,
Nor can the noblest tale retard his speed,
Nor loftiest verse; not that which sung the fall
Of Troy divine and smooth Scamander's stream.
Yet hear a part.--By persecution wrong'd
And popish cruelty, our fathers came
From Europe's shores to find this blest abode,
Secure from tyranny and hateful man.
For this they left their country and their friends
And plough'd th' Atlantic wave in quest of peace;
And found new shores and sylvan settlements
Form'd by the care of each advent'rous chief,
Who, warm in liberty and freedom's cause,
Sought out uncultivated tracts and wilds,
And fram'd new plans of cities, governments
And spacious provinces: Why should I name
Thee Penn, the Solon of our western lands;
Sagacious legislator, whom the world
Admires tho' dead: an infant colony
Nurs'd by thy care, now rises o'er the rest
Like that tall Pyramid on Memphis' stand
O'er all the lesser piles, they also great.
Why should I name those heroes so well known
Who peopled all the rest from Canada
To Georgia's farthest coasts, West Florida
Or Apalachian mountains, yet what streams
Of blood were shed! What Indian hosts were slain
Before the days of peace were quite restor'd.
LEANDER.
Yes, while they overturn'd the soil untill'd,
And swept the forests from the shaded plain
'Midst dangers, foes and death, fierce Indian tribes
With deadly malice arm'd and black design,
Oft murder'd half the hapless colonies.
Encourag'd too by that inglorious race
False Gallia's sons, who once their arms display'd
At Quebec, Montreal and farthest coasts
Of Labrador and Esquimaux where now
The British standard awes the coward host.
Here those brave chiefs, who lavish of their blood
Fought in Britannia's cause, most nobly fell.
What Heart but mourns the untimely fate of Wolf,
Who dying conquer'd, or what breast but beats
To share a fate like his, and die like him?
ACASTO.
And he demands our lay who bravely fell
By Monangahela and the Ohio's stream;
By wiles o'ercome the hapless hero fell,
His soul too gen'rous, for that dastard crew
Who kill unseen and shun the face of day.
Ambush'd in wood, and swamp and thick grown hill,
The bellowing tribes brought on the savage war.
What could avail O Braddock then the flame,
The gen'rous flame which fir'd thy martial soul!
What could avail Britannia's warlike troops,
Choice spirits of her isle? What could avail
America's own sons? The skulking foe,
Hid in the forest lay and sought secure,
What could the brave Virginians do o'erpower'd
By such vast numbers and their leader dead?
'Midst fire and death they bore him from the field,
Where in his blood full many a hero lay.
'Twas there O Halkut! thou so nobly fell,
Thrice valiant Halkut early son of fame!
We still deplore a fate so immature,
Fair Albion mourns thy unsuccesful end,
And Caledonia sheds a tear for him
Who led the bravest of her sons to war.
EUGENIO.
But why alas commemorate the dead?
And pass those glorious heroes by, who yet
Breathe the same air and see the light with us?
The dead, Acasto are but empty names
And he who dy'd to day the same to us
